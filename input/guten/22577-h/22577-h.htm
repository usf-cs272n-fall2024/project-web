PREFACE</h2>

<hr>

<p class="indent">
This book was begun as a result of the author's experience in teaching
some classes in English in the night preparatory department of
the Carnegie Technical Schools of Pittsburg. The pupils in those
classes were all adults, and needed only such a course as would
enable them to express themselves in clear and correct English.
English Grammar, with them, was not to be preliminary to the grammar
of another language, and composition was not to be studied beyond
the everyday needs of the practical man.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Great difficulty was experienced because of inability to secure a
text that was suited to the needs of the class. A book was needed
that would be simple, direct and dignified; that would cover grammar,
and the essential principles of sentence structure, choice of words,
and general composition; that would deal particularly with the sources
of frequent error, and would omit the non-essential points; and,
finally that would contain an abundance of exercises and practical
work.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is with these ends in view that this book has been prepared. The
parts devoted to grammar have followed a plan varying widely from
that of most grammars, and an effort has been made to secure a more
sensible and effective treatment. The parts devoted to composition
contain brief expositions of only the essential principles of ordinary
composition. Especial stress has been laid upon letter-writing,
since this is believed to be one of the most practical fields for
actual composition work. Because such a style seemed best suited to
the general scheme and purpose of the book, the method of treatment
has at times been intentionally rather formal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_vi"><span class="page">Page vi</span></a> Abundant
and varied exercises have been incorporated at frequent intervals
throughout the text. So far as was practicable the exercises have
been kept constructive in their nature, and upon critical points
have been made very extensive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The author claims little credit except for the plan of the book
and for the labor that he has expended in developing the details of
that plan and in devising the various exercises. In the statement
of principles and in the working out of details great originality
would have been as undesirable as it was impossible. Therefore,
for these details the author has drawn from the great common stores
of learning upon the subjects discussed. No doubt many traces of
the books that he has used in study and in teaching may be found
in this volume. He has, at times, consciously adapted matter from
other texts; but, for the most part, such slight borrowings as
may be discovered have been made wholly unconsciously. Among the
books to which he is aware of heavy literary obligations are the
following excellent texts: Lockwood and Emerson's Composition and
Rhetoric, Sherwin Cody's Errors in Composition, A. H. Espenshade's
Composition and Rhetoric, Edwin C. Woolley's Handbook of Composition,
McLean, Blaisdell and Morrow's Steps in English, Huber Gray Buehler's
Practical Exercises in English, and Carl C. Marshall's Business
English.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To Messrs. Ginn and Company, publishers of Lockwood and Emerson's
Composition and Rhetoric, and to the Goodyear-Marshall Publishing
Company, publishers of Marshall's Business English, the author is
indebted for their kind permission to make a rather free adaptation
of certain parts of their texts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not a little gratitude does the author owe to those of his friends
who have encouraged and aided him in the preparation of his manuscript,
and to the careful criticisms and suggestions made by those persons
who examined the completed manuscript in behalf of his publishers.
Above all, a great debt of <a name="page_vii"><span class="page">Page
vii</span></a> gratitude is owed to Mr. Grant Norris, Superintendent
of Schools, Braddock, Pennsylvania, for the encouragement and
painstaking aid he has given both in preparation of the manuscript
and in reading the proof of the book.

PRACTICAL GRAMMAR AND COMPOSITION
</p>

<hr>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subtitle">
SENTENCES.&mdash;PARTS OF SPEECH.&mdash;ELEMENTS OF THE
SENTENCE.&mdash;PHRASES AND CLAUSES
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>1.</b> In thinking we arrange and associate ideas and objects
together. Words are the symbols of ideas or objects. A <b>Sentence</b>
is a group of words that expresses a single complete thought.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>2. Sentences</b> are of four kinds:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. <b>Declarative;</b> a sentence that tells or declares something;
as, <i>That book is mine</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. <b>Imperative;</b> a sentence that expresses a command; as, <i>Bring
me that book</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. <b>Interrogative;</b> a sentence that asks a question; as, <i>Is
that book mine?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. <b>Exclamatory;</b> a declarative, imperative, or interrogative
sentence that expresses violent emotion, such as terror, surprise,
or anger; as, <i>You shall take that book!</i> or, <i>Can that
book be mine?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>3. Parts of Speech.</b> Words have different uses in sentences.
According to their uses, words are divided into classes called
Parts of Speech. The parts of speech are as follows:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. <b>Noun;</b> a word used as the name of something; as, <i>man,
box, Pittsburgh, Harry, silence, justice</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_2"><span class="page">Page 2</span></a> 2. <b>Pronoun;</b>
a word used instead of a noun; as, <i>I, he, it, that.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nouns, pronouns, or groups of words that are used as nouns or pronouns,
are called by the general term, <b>Substantives</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. <b>Adjective;</b> a word used to limit or qualify the meaning
of a noun or a pronoun; as, <i>good, five, tall, many</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The words <i>a, an</i>, and <i>the</i> are words used to modify
nouns or pronouns. They are adjectives, but are usually called
<b>Articles</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. <b>Verb;</b> a word used to state something about some person
or thing; as, <i>do, see, think, make</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. <b>Adverb;</b> a word used to modify the meaning of a verb, an
adjective, or another adverb; as, <i>very, slowly, clearly, often</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
6. <b>Preposition;</b> a word used to join a substantive, as a
modifier, to some other preceding word, and to show the relation of
the substantive to that word; as, <i>by, in, between, beyond</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
7. <b>Conjunction;</b> a word used to connect words, phrases, clauses,
and sentences; as, <i>and, but, if, although, or</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
8. <b>Interjection;</b> a word used to express surprise or emotion;
as, <i>Oh! Alas! Hurrah! Bah!</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sometimes a word adds nothing to the meaning of the sentence, but
helps to fill out its form or sound, and serves as a device to alter
its natural order. Such a word is called an <b>Expletive.</b> In the
following sentence <i>there</i> is an expletive: <i><b>There</b>
are no such books in print</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>4.</b> A sentence is made up of distinct parts or elements.
The essential or <b>Principal Elements</b> are the Subject and the
Predicate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Subject</b> of a sentence is the part which mentions that
about which something is said. The <b>Predicate</b> is the part
which states that which is said about the subject. <i>Man walks</i>.
In this sentence, <i>man</i> is the subject, and <i>walks</i> is
the predicate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_3"><span class="page">Page 3</span></a> The subject
may be simple or modified; that is, may consist of the subject
alone, or of the subject with its modifiers. The same is true of
the predicate. Thus, in the sentence, <i>Man walks</i>, there is
a simple subject and a simple predicate. In the sentence, <i>The
good man walks very rapidly</i>, there is a modified subject and
a modified predicate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There may be, also, more than one subject connected with the same
predicate; as, <i><b>The man and the woman</b> walk</i>. This is
called a <b>Compound Subject</b>. A <b>Compound Predicate</b> consists
of more than one predicate used with the same subject; as, <i>The
man <b>both walks and runs</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>5.</b> Besides the principal elements in a sentence, there are
<b>Subordinate Elements.</b> These are the Attribute Complement,
the Object Complement, the Adjective Modifier, and the Adverbial
Modifier.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some verbs, to complete their sense, need to be followed by some
other word or group of words. These words which "complement," or
complete the meanings of verbs are called <b>Complements</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Attribute Complement</b> completes the meaning of the verb
by stating some class, condition, or attribute of the subject;
as, <i>My friend is a <b>student</b>, I am <b>well</b>, The man
is <b>good</b> Student, well</i>, and <i>good</i> complete the
meanings of their respective verbs, by stating some class, condition,
or attribute of the subjects of the verbs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The attribute complement usually follows the verb <i>be</i> or its
forms, <i>is, are, was, will be</i>, etc. The attribute complement
is usually a noun, pronoun, or adjective, although it may be a
phrase or clause fulfilling the function of any of these parts
of speech. It must not be confused with an adverb or an adverbial
modifier. In the sentence, <i>He is <b>there</b>, there</i> is
an adverb, not an attribute complement.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The verb used with an attribute complement, because such verb
<i>joins</i> the subject to its attribute, is called the <b>Copula</b>
("to couple") or <b>Copulative Verb</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_4"><span class="page">Page 4</span></a> Some verbs
require an object to complete their meaning. This object is called the
<b>Object Complement</b>. In the sentence, <i>I carry a <b>book</b></i>,
the object, <i>book</i>, is required to complete the meaning of
the transitive verb <i>carry</i>; so, also in the sentences, <i>I
hold the <b>horse</b></i>, and <i>I touch a <b>desk</b></i>, the
objects <i>horse</i> and <i>desk</i> are necessary to complete
the meanings of their respective verbs. These verbs that require
objects to complete their meaning are called Transitive Verbs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Adjective</b> and <b>Adverbial Modifiers</b> may consist simply of
adjectives and adverbs, or of phrases and clauses used as adjectives
or adverbs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>6.</b> A <b>Phrase</b> is a group of words that is used as a
single part of speech and that does not contain a subject and a
predicate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A <b>Prepositional Phrase</b>, always used as either an adjective
or an adverbial modifier, consists of a preposition with its object
and the modifiers of the object; as, <i>He lives <b>in Pittsburg</b>,
Mr. Smith <b>of this place</b> is the manager <b>of the mill</b>,
The letter is <b>in the nearest desk</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are also Verb-phrases. A <b>Verb-phrase</b> is a phrase that
serves as a verb; as, <i>I <b>am coming</b>, He <b>shall be told</b>,
He <b>ought to have been told</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>7.</b> A <b>Clause</b> is a group of words containing a subject
and a predicate; as, <i>The man <b>that I saw</b> was tall</i>.
The clause, <i>that I saw</i>, contains both a subject, <i>I</i>,
and a predicate, <i>saw</i>. This clause, since it merely states
something of minor importance in the sentence, is called the
<b>Subordinate Clause</b>. The <b>Principal Clause</b>, the one
making the most important assertion, is, <i>The man was tall</i>.
Clauses may be used as adjectives, as adverbs, and as nouns. A
clause used as a noun is called a <b>Substantive Clause</b>. Examine
the following examples:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
Adjective Clause: The book <i>that I want</i> is a history.<br />
Adverbial Clause: He came <i>when he had finished with the
  work</i>.<br />
Noun Clause as subject: <i>That I am here</i> is true.<br />
Noun Clause as object: He said <i>that I was mistaken</i>.

Sentences, as to their composition, are classified as follows:
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Simple;</b> a sentence consisting of a single statement; as,
<i>The man walks</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Complex;</b> a sentence consisting of one principal clause and one
or more subordinate clauses; as, <i>The man that I saw is tall</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Compound;</b> a sentence consisting of two or more clauses of
equal importance connected by conjunctions expressed or understood;
as, <i>The man is tall and walks rapidly</i>, and <i>Watch the
little things; they are important</i>.

CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subtitle">NOUNS</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>9.</b> A noun has been defined as a word used as the name of
something. It may be the name of a person, a place, a thing, or
of some abstract quality, such as, <i>justice</i> or <i>truth</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>10. Common and Proper Nouns.</b> A <b>Proper Noun</b> is a noun
that names some particular or special place, person, people, or
thing. A proper noun should always begin with a capital letter;
as, <i>English, Rome, Jews, John</i>. A <b>Common Noun</b> is a
general or class name.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>11. Inflection Defined.</b> The variation in the forms of the
different parts of speech to show grammatical relation, is called
<b>Inflection</b>. Though there is some inflection in English,
grammatical relation is usually shown by position rather than by
inflection.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The noun is inflected to show number, case, and gender.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>12. Number</b> is that quality of a word which shows whether it
refers to one or to more than one. <b>Singular Number</b> refers
to one. <b>Plural Number</b> refers to more than one.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>13. Plurals of singular nouns are formed according to the following
rules:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Most nouns add <i>s</i> to the singular; as, <i>boy, boys; stove,
stoves</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Nouns ending in <i>s, ch, sh</i>, or <i>x</i>, add <i>es</i>
to the singular; as, <i>fox, foxes; wish, wishes; glass, glasses;
coach, coaches</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Nouns ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a vowel (<i>a, e, i, o,
u</i>) add <i>s</i>; as, <i>valley, valleys</i>, (<i>soliloquy,
soliloquies</i> and <i>colloquy, colloquies</i> are exceptions).
When <i>y</i> is preceded by a consonant (any letter other than
a vowel), <i>y</i> is changed to <i>i</i> and <i>es</i> is added;
as, <i>army, armies; pony, ponies; sty, sties</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. Most nouns ending in <i>f</i> or <i>fe</i> add <i>s</i>, as,
<i>scarf, scarfs; safe, safes</i>. <a name="page_8"><span
class="page">Page 8</span></a> A few change <i>f</i> or <i>fe</i>
to <i>v</i> and add <i>es</i>; as, <i>wife, wives; self, selves</i>.
The others are: <i>beef, calf, elf, half, leaf, loaf, sheaf, shelf,
staff, thief, wharf, wolf, life</i>. (<i>Wharf</i> has also a plural,
<i>wharfs</i>.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. Most nouns ending in <i>o</i> add <i>s</i>; as, <i>cameo, cameos</i>.
A number of nouns ending in <i>o</i> preceded by a consonant add
<i>es</i>; as, <i>volcano, volcanoes</i>. The most important of
the latter class are: <i>buffalo, cargo, calico, echo, embargo,
flamingo, hero, motto, mulatto, negro, potato, tomato, tornado,
torpedo, veto</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
6. Letters, figures, characters, etc., add the apostrophe and <i>s</i>
(<i>'s</i>); as, <i>6's, c's, t's, that's</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
7. The following common words always form their plurals in an irregular
way; as, <i>man, men; ox, oxen; goose, geese; woman, women; foot,
feet; mouse, mice; child, children; tooth, teeth; louse, lice</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Compound Nouns</b> are those formed by the union of two words,
either two nouns or a noun joined to some descriptive word or phrase.
</p>

<p class="indent">
8. The principal noun of a compound noun, whether it precedes or
follows the descriptive part, is in most cases the noun that changes
in forming the plural; as, <i>mothers-in-law, knights-errant,
mouse-traps</i>. In a few compound words, both parts take a plural form;
as, <i>man-servant, men-servants; knight-templar, knights-templars</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
9. Proper names and titles generally form plurals in the same way
as do other nouns; as, <i>Senators Webster and Clay, the three
Henrys</i>. Abbreviations of titles are little used in the plural,
except <i>Messrs.</i> (<i>Mr.</i>), and <i>Drs.</i> (<i>Dr.</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
10. In forming the plurals of proper names where a title is used,
either the title or the name may be put in the plural form. Sometimes
both are made plural; as, <i>Miss Brown, the Misses Brown, the
Miss Browns, the two Mrs. Browns</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
11. Some nouns are the same in both the singular and the plural;
as, <i>deer, series, means, gross</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
12. Some nouns used in two senses have two plural forms. The most
important are the following:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <tr><td><b>brother</b></td><td><i>brothers</i> (by blood)</td>
     <td><i>brethren</i> (by association)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>cloth</b></td><td><i>cloths</i> (kinds of cloth)</td>
     <td><i>clothes</i> (garments)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>die</b></td><td><i>dies</i> (for coinage)</td>
     <td><i>dice</i> (for games)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>fish</b></td><td><i>fishes</i> (separately)</td>
     <td><i>fish</i> (collectively)
  <a name="page_9"><span class="page">Page 9</span></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>genius</b></td><td><i>geniuses</i> (men of genius)</td>
     <td><i>genii</i> (imaginary beings)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>head</b></td><td><i>heads</i> (of the body)</td>
     <td><i>head</i> (of cattle)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>index</b></td><td><i>indexes</i> (of books)</td>
     <td><i>indices</i> (in algebra)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>pea</b></td><td><i>peas</i> (separately)</td>
     <td><i>pease</i> (collectively)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>penny</b></td><td><i>pennies</i> (separately)</td>
     <td><i>pence</i> (collectively)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>sail</b></td><td><i>sails</i> (pieces of canvas)</td>
     <td><i>sail</i> (number of vessels)</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>shot</b></td><td><i> shots</i> (number of discharges)</td>
     <td><i>shot</i> (number of balls)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
13. Nouns from foreign languages frequently retain in the plural
the form that they have in the language from which they are taken;
as, <i>focus, foci; terminus, termini; alumnus, alumni; datum, data;
stratum, strata; formula, formul&oelig;; vortex, vortices; appendix,
appendices; crisis, crises; oasis, oases; axis, axes; phenomenon,
phenomena; automaton, automata; analysis, analyses; hypothesis,
hypotheses; medium, media; vertebra, vertebr&oelig;; ellipsis, ellipses;
genus, genera; fungus, fungi; minimum, minima; thesis, theses</i>.
</p>

<p class="exercise">Exercise 3</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Write the plural, if any, of every singular noun in the following
list; and the singular, if any, of every plural noun. Note those
having no singular and those having no plural</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
News, goods, thanks, scissors, proceeds, puppy, studio, survey,
attorney, arch, belief, chief, charity, half, hero, negro, majority,
Mary, vortex, memento, joy, lily, knight-templar, knight-errant, why,
4, x, son-in-law, Miss Smith, Mr. Anderson, country-man, hanger-on,
major-general, oxen, geese, man-servant, brethren, strata, sheep,
mathematics, pride, money, pea, head, piano, veto, knives, ratios,
alumni, feet, wolves, president, sailor-boy, spoonful, rope-ladder,
grandmother, attorney-general, cupful, go-between.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>When in doubt respecting the form of any of the above, consult
an unabridged dictionary.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>14. Case.</b> There are three cases in English: the Nominative,
the Possessive, and the Objective.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Nominative Case;</b> the form used in address and as the
subject of a verb.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Objective Case;</b> the form used as the object of a verb or
a preposition. It is always the same in form as is the nominative.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_10"><span class="page">Page 10</span></a> Since no
error in grammar can arise in the use of the nominative or the
objective cases of nouns, no further discussion of these cases is
here needed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Possessive Case</b>; the form used to show ownership. In
the forming of this case we have inflection.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>15. The following are the rules for the forming of the possessive
case:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Most nouns form the possessive by adding the apostrophe and
<i>s</i> (<i>'s</i>); as, <i>man, man's; men, men's; pupil, pupil's;
John, John's</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Plural nouns ending in <i>s</i> form the possessive by adding
only the apostrophe ('); as, <i>persons, persons'; writers,
writers'</i>. In stating possession in the plural, then one should
say: <i>Carpenters' tools sharpened here, Odd Fellows' wives are
invited</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Some singular nouns ending in an <i>s</i> sound form the possessive
by adding the apostrophe alone; as, <i>for appearance' sake, for
goodness' sake</i>. But usage inclines to the adding of the apostrophe
and <i>s</i> (<i>'s</i>) even if the singular noun does end in
an <i>s</i> sound; as, <i>Charles's book, Frances's dress, the
mistress's dress</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. When a compound noun, or a group of words treated as one name,
is used to denote possession, the sign of the possessive is added
to the last word only; as, <i>Charles and John's mother</i> (the
mother of both Charles and John), <i>Brown and Smith's store</i>
(the store of the firm Brown &amp; Smith).
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. Where the succession of possessives is unpleasant or confusing,
the substitution of a prepositional phrase should be made; as,
<i>the house of the mother of Charles's partner</i>, instead of,
<i>Charles's partner's mother's house</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
6. The sign of the possessive should be used with the word immediately
preceding the word naming the thing possessed; as, <i>Father and
mother's house, Smith, the lawyer's, office, The Senator from Utah's
seat</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
7. Generally, nouns representing inanimate objects should not be
used in the possessive case. It is better to say <i>the hands of
the clock</i> than <i>the clock's hands</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note.</span>&mdash;One
should say <i>somebody else's</i>, not <i>somebody's else</i>. The
expression <i>somebody else</i> always occurs in the one form, and
in such cases the sign of the possessive should be added to the last
word. Similarly, say, <i>no one else's, everybody else's</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="exercise">
<a name="page_11"><span class="page">Page 11</span></a>
Exercise 4</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Write the possessives of the following:</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Oxen, ox, brother-in-law, Miss Jones, goose, man, men, men-servants,

</ol>

<p class="indent">
16. <b>Gender.</b> Gender in grammar is the quality of nouns or
pronouns that denotes the sex of the person or thing represented.
Those nouns or pronouns meaning males are in the <b>Masculine
Gender</b>. Those meaning females are in the <b>Feminine Gender</b>.
Those referring to things without sex are in the <b>Neuter Gender</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In nouns gender is of little consequence. The only regular inflection
is the addition of the syllable-<i>ess</i> to certain masculine
nouns to denote the change to the feminine gender; as, <i>author,
authoress; poet, poetess</i>. -I<i>x</i> is also sometimes added
for the same purpose; as, <i>administrator, administratrix</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The feminine forms were formerly much used, but their use is now
being discontinued, and the noun of masculine gender used to designate
both sexes.
</p>

<h2><a name="page_13"><span class="page">Page 13</span></a>
CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subtitle">PRONOUNS</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>17. Pronoun and Antecedent.</b> A <b>Pronoun</b> is a word used
instead of a noun. The noun in whose stead it stands is called its
<b>Antecedent</b>. <i><b>John</b> took Mary's <b>book</b> and gave
<b>it</b> to <b>his</b> friend</i>. In this sentence <i>book</i>
is the antecedent of the pronoun <i>it</i>, and <i>John</i> is the
antecedent of <i>his</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>18. Pronouns should agree with their antecedents in person, gender,
and number.</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>19. Personal Pronouns</b> are those that by their form indicate
the speaker, the person spoken to, or the person or thing spoken
about.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Pronouns of the <b>First Person</b> indicate the speaker; they are:
<i>I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Pronouns of the <b>Second Person</b> indicate the person or thing
spoken to; they are: <i>you, your, yours</i>. There are also the
grave or solemn forms in the second person, which are now little
used; these are: <i>thou, thee, thy, thine</i>, and <i>ye</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Pronouns of the <b>Third Person</b> indicate the person or thing
spoken of; they are: <i>he, his, him, she, her, hers, they, their,
theirs, them, it, its</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Few errors are made in the use of the proper person of the pronoun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>20. Gender of Pronouns.</b> The following pronouns indicate
sex or gender; Masculine: <i>he, his, him</i>. Feminine: <i>she,
her, hers</i>. Neuter: <i>it, its</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>In order to secure agreement in gender it is necessary to know
the gender of the noun, expressed or understood, to which the pronoun
refers.</b> Gender of nouns is important only so far as it concerns
the use of pronouns. Study carefully the <a name="page_14"><span
class="page">Page 14</span></a> following rules in regard to gender.
These rules apply to the singular number only, since all plurals
of whatever gender are referred to by <i>they, their, theirs</i>,
etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The following rules govern the gender of pronouns:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Masculine;</b> referred to by <b><i>he, his</i></b>, and
<b><i>him</i></b>:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Nouns denoting males are always masculine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Nouns denoting things remarkable for strength, power, sublimity,
or size, when those things are regarded as if they were persons,
are masculine; <i>as, <b>Winter</b>, with <b>his</b> chilly army,
destroyed them all</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Singular nouns denoting persons of both sexes are masculine;
as, <i><b>Every one</b> brought <b>his</b> umbrella</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Feminine;</b> referred to by <b><i>she, her</i></b>, or
<b><i>hers</i></b>:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Nouns denoting females are always feminine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Nouns denoting objects remarkable for beauty, gentleness, and
peace, when spoken of as if they were persons, are feminine; as,
<i><b>Sleep</b> healed him with <b>her</b> fostering care</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Neuter;</b> referred to by <b><i>it</i></b> and <b><i>its</i></b>:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Nouns denoting objects without sex are neuter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Nouns denoting objects whose sex is disregarded are neuter;
as, <i><b>It</b> is a pretty child, The <b>wolf</b> is the most
savage of <b>its</b> race</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Collective nouns referring to a group of individuals as a unit
are neuter; as, <i>The <b>jury</b> gives its <b>verdict</b>, The
<b>committee</b> makes <b>its</b> report</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
An animal named may be regarded as masculine; feminine, or neuter,
according to the characteristics the writer fancies it to possess;
as, <i>The <b>wolf</b> seeks <b>his</b> prey, The <b>mouse</b>
nibbled <b>her</b> way into the box, The <b>bird</b> seeks <b>its</b>
nest.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Certain nouns may be applied to persons of either sex. They are
then said to be of <b>Common Gender</b>. There are no pronouns
of common gender; hence those nouns are referred to as follows:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. By masculine pronouns when known to denote males; as, <i><b>My
class-mate</b></i> (known to be Harry) <i>is taking <b>his</b>
examinations</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. By feminine pronouns when known to denote females; as, <i><b>Each
of the pupils</b> of the Girls High School brought <b>her</b> book.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_15"><span class="page">Page 15</span></a> 3. By masculine
pronouns when there is nothing in the connection of the thought to
show the sex of the object; as, <i>Let every <b>person</b> bring
his book</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>21. Number of Pronouns.</b> A more common source of error than
disagreement in gender is disagreement in number. <i>They, their,
theirs</i>, and <i>them</i> are plural, but are often improperly
used when only singular pronouns should be used. The cause of the
error is failure to realize the true antecedent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>If <b>anybody</b> makes that statement, <b>they</b> are
misinformed</i>. This sentence is wrong. <i>Anybody</i> refers
to only one person; both <i>any</i> and <i>body</i>, the parts
of the word, denote the singular. The sentence should read, <i>If
<b>anybody</b> makes that statement, <b>he</b> is misinformed.</i>
Similarly, <i>Let <b>everybody</b> keep <b>their</b> peace</i>,
should read, <i>Let <b>everybody</b> keep <b>his</b> peace.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>22. Compound Antecedents.</b> Two or more antecedents connected
by <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i> are frequently referred to by the plural
when the singular should be used. <i>Neither John nor James brought
<b>their</b> books</i>, should read, <i>Neither John nor James
brought <b>his</b> books</i>. When a pronoun has two or more singular
antecedents connected by <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i>, the pronoun must
be in the singular number; but if one of the antecedents is plural,
the pronoun must, also, be in the plural; as, <i>Neither the Mormon
nor his wives denied <b>their</b> religion</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When a pronoun has two or more antecedents connected by <i>and</i>,
the pronoun must be in the plural number; as, <i>John and James
brought <b>their</b> books</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Further treatment of number will be given under verbs.
</p>

<b>23. Relative Pronouns.</b> Relative Pronouns are pronouns used
to introduce adjective or noun clauses that are not interrogative.
In the sentence, <i>The man <b>that I mentioned</b> has come</i>,
the relative clause, <i>that I mentioned</i>, is an adjective clause
modifying <i>man</i>. In the sentence, <i><b>Whom she means</b>,
I do not know</i>, the relative clause is, <i>whom she means</i>,
and is a noun clause forming the object of the verb <i>know</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_18"><span class="page">Page 18</span></a> The relative
pronouns are <i>who</i> (<i>whose, whom</i>), <i>which, that</i>
and <i>what</i>. <i>But</i> and <i>as</i> are sometimes relative
pronouns. There are, also, compound relative pronouns, which will
be mentioned later.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>24.</b> <i>Who</i> (with its possessive and objective forms,
<i>whose</i> and <i>whom</i>) should be used when the antecedent
denotes persons. When the antecedent denotes things or animals,
<i>which</i> should be used. <i>That</i> may be used with antecedents
denoting persons, animals or things, and is the proper relative
to use when the antecedent includes both persons and things.
<i>What</i>, when used as a relative, seldom properly refers to
persons. It always introduces a substantive clause, and is equivalent
to <i>that which</i>; as, <i>It is <b>what</b> (that which) he
wants</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>25.</b> <i>That</i> is known as the <b>Restrictive Relative</b>,
because it should be used whenever the relative clause limits the
substantive, unless <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> is of more pleasing
sound in the sentence. In the sentence, <i>He is the man <b>that
did the act</b></i>, the relative clause, <i>that did the act</i>,
defines what is meant by man; without the relative clause the sentence
clearly would be incomplete. Similarly, in the sentence, <i>The book
<b>that I want</b> is that red-backed history</i>, the restrictive
relative clause is, <i>that <b>I</b> want</i>, and limits the
application of <i>book</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>26.</b> <i>Who</i> and <i>which</i> are known as the
<b>Explanatory</b> or <b>Non-Restrictive Relatives</b>, and should
be used ordinarily only to introduce relative clauses which add some
new thought to the author's principal thought. <i>Spanish, <b>which
is the least complex language</b>, is the easiest to learn</i>. In
this sentence the principal thought is, <i>Spanish is the easiest
language to learn</i>. The relative clause, <i>which is the least
complex language</i>, is a thought, which, though not fully so
important as the principal thought, is more nearly co&ouml;rdinate
than subordinate in its value. It adds an additional thought of
the speaker explaining the character of the Spanish language. When
<i>who</i> and <i>which</i> are thus used as explanatory relatives,
we see <a name="page_19"><span class="page">Page 19</span></a> that
the relative clause may be omitted without making the sentence
incomplete.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Compare the following sentences:
</p>

<p class="indent">
Explanatory relative clause: That book, <i>which is about history</i>,
has a red cover.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Restrictive relative clause: The book <i>that is about history</i>
has a red cover.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Explanatory relative clause: Lincoln, <i>who was one of the world's
greatest men</i>, was killed by Booth.

<b>27. Interrogative Pronouns.</b> An Interrogative Pronoun is a
pronoun used to ask a question. The interrogative pronouns are,
<i>who</i> (<i>whose, whom</i>), <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i>. In
respect to antecedents, <i>who</i> should be used only in reference
to persons; <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> may be used with any
antecedent, persons, animals, or things.

<b>28. Case Forms of Pronouns.</b> Some personal, relative, and
interrogative pronouns have distinctive forms for the different
cases, and the failure to use the proper case forms in the sentence
is one of the most frequent sources of error. The case to be used is
to be determined by the use which the pronoun, not its antecedent,
has in the sentence. In the sentence, <i>I name <b>him</b></i>,
note that <i>him</i> is the object of the verb <i>name</i>. In
the sentence, <i><b>Whom</b> do you seek</i>, although coming at
the <a name="page_21"><span class="page">Page 21</span></a> first
of the sentence, <i>whom</i> is grammatically the object of the
verb <i>seek</i>. In the use of pronouns comes the most important
need for a knowledge of when to use the different cases.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Note the following different case forms of pronouns:
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nominative: <i>I, we, you, thou, ye, he, she, they, it, who</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Objective: <i>me, us, you, thee, ye, him, her, it, them, whom</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Possessive: <i>my, mine, our, ours, thy, thine, your, yours, his,
her, hers, its, their, theirs, whose</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It will be noted that, while some forms are the same in both the
nominative and objective cases, <b><i>I, we, he, she, they, thou</i>,
and <i>who</i> are only proper where the nominative case should be
used. <i>Me, us, him, them, thee, whom</i>, and <i>her</i></b>,
except when <i>her</i> is possessive, <b>are only proper when the
objective case is demanded</b>. These forms must be remembered.
It is only with these pronouns that mistakes are made in the use
of the nominative and objective cases.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>29. The following outline explains the use of the different
case forms of the pronouns.</b> The outline should be mastered.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Nominative Case should be used:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. When the noun or pronoun is the subject of a finite verb; that
is, a verb other than an infinitive. See 3 under Objective Case.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. When it is an attribute complement. An attribute complement, as
explained in Chapter I, is a word used in the predicate explaining or
stating something about the subject. Examples: <i>It is <b>I</b>, The
man was <b>he</b>, The people were <b>they</b> of whom we spoke.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. When it is used without relation to any other part of speech,
as in direct address or exclamation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Objective Case should be used:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. When the noun or pronoun is the object of a verb; as, <i>He
named <b>me</b>, She deceived <b>them</b>, They watch <b>us</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. When it is the object of a preposition, expressed or understood:
as, <i>He spoke of <b>me</b>, For <b>whom</b> do you take me, He
told (to) <b>me</b> a story.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. When it is the subject of an infinitive; as, <i>I told <b>him</b>
to go, I desire <b>her</b> to hope</i>. The infinitives are the
parts of the verb preceded by <i>to</i>; as, <i>to go, to see, to
be, to have been seen</i>, etc. The sign <a name="page_22"><span
class="page">Page 22</span></a> of the infinitive, to, is not always
expressed. The objective case is, nevertheless, used; as, <i>Let
<b>him</b> (to) go, Have <b>her</b> (to be) told about it.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. When it is an attribute complement of an expressed subject of the
infinitive <i>to be</i>; as, <i>They believed her to be <b>me</b>,
He denied it to have been him</i>. (See Note 2 below.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>The Possessive Case should be used:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
When the word is used as a possessive modifier; as, <i>They spoke
of <b>her</b> being present, The book is <b>his</b> (book), It
is <b>their</b> fault.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note 1.</span>&mdash;When
a substantive is placed by the side of another substantive and is
used to explain it, it is said to be in <b>Apposition</b> with that
other substantive and takes the case of that word; as, <i>It</i>
was given <i>to John Smith, <b>him</b> whom you see there.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note 2.</span>&mdash;The
attribute complement should always have the case of that subject
of the verb which is expressed in the sentence. Thus, in the
sentence, <i>I could not wish John to be <b>him</b>, him</i> is
properly in the objective case, since there is an expressed
subject of the infinitive, <i>John</i>, which is in the objective
case. But in the sentence, <i>I should hate to be <b>he</b>, he</i>
is properly in the nominative case, since the only subject that
is expressed in the sentence is <i>I</i>, in the nominative case.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note 3.</span>&mdash;Where
the relative pronoun <i>who (whom)</i> is the subject of a clause
that itself is the object clause of a verb or a preposition, it is
always in the nominative case. Thus the following sentences are
both correct: <i>I delivered it to <b>who</b> owned it, Bring home
<b>whoever</b> will come with you.</i>

<b>30.</b> The <b>Compound Personal Pronouns</b> are formed by
adding <i>self</i> or <i>selves</i> to certain of the objective
and possessive personal pronouns; as, <i>herself, myself, itself,
themselves</i>, etc. They are used to add emphasis to an expression;
as, <i>I, <b>myself</b>, did it, He, <b>himself</b>, said so.</i>
They are also used reflexively after verbs and prepositions; as,
<i>He mentioned <b>himself</b>, He did it for <b>himself</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The compound personal pronouns should generally be confined to
their emphatic and reflexive use. Do not say, <i><b>Myself</b> and
John will come</i>, but, <i>John and <b>I</b> will come</i>. Do
not say, <i>They invited John and <b>myself</b></i>, but, <i>They
invited John and <b>me</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The compound personal pronouns have no possessive forms; but for
the sake of emphasis <i>own</i> with the ordinary possessive form
is used; as, <i>I have my <b>own</b> book, Bring your <b>own</b>

<b>33.</b> There are certain words, called <b>Adjective Pronouns</b>,
which are regarded as pronouns, because, although they are properly
adjective in their meaning, the nouns which they modify are never
expressed; as, <i>One</i> (there is a possessive form, <a
name="page_29"><span class="page">Page 29</span></a> <i>one's</i>,
and a plural form, <i>ones</i>), <i>none, this, that, these, those,
other, former, some, few, many</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>34. Some miscellaneous cautions in the use of pronouns:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. The pronoun <i>I</i> should always be capitalized, and should,
when used as part of a compound subject, be placed second; as,
<i>James and I were present, not I and James were present</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Do not use the common and grave forms of the personal pronouns in
the same sentence; as, <i><b>Thou</b> wilt do this whether <b>you</b>
wish or not</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Avoid the use of personal pronouns where they are unnecessary;
as, <i>John, <b>he</b> did it, or Mary, <b>she</b> said</i>. This
is a frequent error in speech.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. Let the antecedent of each pronoun be clearly apparent. Note the
uncertainty in the following sentence; <i>He sent a box of cheese,
and <b>it</b> was made of wood</i>. The antecedent of <i>it</i> is
not clear. Again, <i>A man told his son to take <b>his</b> coat
home</i>. The antecedent of <i>his</i> is very uncertain. Such
errors are frequent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In relative clauses this error may sometimes be avoided by placing
the relative clause as near as possible to the noun it limits.
Note the following sentence: <i>A cat was found in the <b>yard
which</b> wore a blue ribbon</i>. The grammatical inference would
be that the yard wore the blue ribbon. The sentence might be changed
to, <i>A <b>cat, which</b> wore a blue ribbon, was found in the
yard</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. Relative clauses referring to the same thing require the same
relative pronoun to introduce them; as, <i>The book <b>that</b>
we found and the book <b>that</b> he lost are the same</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
6. Use <i>but that</i> when <i>but</i> is a conjunction and <i>that</i>
introduces a noun clause; as, <i>There is no doubt <b>but that</b>
he will go</i>. Use <i>but what</i> when <i>but</i> is a preposition
in the sense of <i>except</i>; as, <i>He has no money but (except)
<b>what</b> I gave him</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
7. <i>Them</i> is a pronoun and should never be used as an adjective.
<i>Those</i> is the adjective which should be used in its place;
as, <i>Those people</i>, not, <i>Them people</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
8. Avoid using <i>you</i> and <i>they</i> indefinitely; as,
<i><b>You</b> seldom hear of such things, <b>They</b> make chairs
there</i>. Instead, say, <i><b>One</b> seldom hears of such things,
Chairs are made there</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
9. <i>Which</i> should not be used with a clause or phrase as its
antecedent. Both the following sentences are wrong: <i>He sent me
to see <a name="page_30"><span class="page">Page 30</span></a>
John, <b>which</b> I did. Their whispering became very loud, which
annoyed the preacher</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
10. Never use an apostrophe with the possessive pronouns, <i>its,
yours, theirs, ours</i> and <i>hers</i>.
</p>

CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subtitle">ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>35.</b> An <b>Adjective</b> is a word used to modify a noun
or a pronoun. An <b>Adverb</b> is a word used to modify a verb,
an adjective, or another adverb. Adjectives and adverbs are very
closely related in both their forms and their use.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>36. Comparison.</b> The variation of adjectives and adverbs
to indicate the degree of modification they express is called
<b>Comparison</b>. There are three degrees of comparison.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Positive Degree</b> indicates the mere possession of a quality;
as, <i>true, good, sweet, fast, lovely</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Comparative Degree</b> indicates a stronger degree of the
quality than the positive; as, <i>truer, sweeter, better, faster,
lovelier</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Superlative Degree</b> indicates the highest degree of quality;
as, <i>truest, sweetest, best, fastest, loveliest</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where the adjectives and adverbs are compared by inflection they are
said to be compared regularly. In regular comparison the comparative
is formed by adding <i>er</i>, and the superlative by adding <i>est</i>.
If the word ends in <i>y</i>, the <i>y</i> is changed to <i>i</i>
before adding the ending; as, <i>pretty, prettier, prettiest</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where the adjectives and adverbs have two or more syllables, most
of them are compared by the use of the adverbs <i>more</i> and
<i>most</i>, or, if the comparison be a descending one, by the use
of <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>; as, <i>beautiful, more beautiful,
most beautiful</i>, and <i>less beautiful, least beautiful</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>37.</b> Some adjectives and adverbs are compared by changing
to entirely different words in the comparative and superlative.
Note the following:
<a name="page_33"><span class="page">Page 33</span></a>
</p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <tr><td class="center">POSITIVE</td>
     <td class="center">COMPARATIVE</td>
     <td class="center">SUPERLATIVE</td></tr>
 <tr><td>bad, ill, evil, badly</td> <td>worse</td>
     <td>worst</td></tr>
 <tr><td>far</td> <td>farther, further</td>
     <td>farthest, furthest</td></tr>
 <tr><td>forth</td> <td>further</td> <td>furthest</td></tr>
 <tr><td>fore</td> <td>former</td> <td>foremost, first</td></tr>
 <tr><td>good, well</td> <td>better</td> <td>best</td></tr>
 <tr><td>hind</td> <td>hinder</td> <td>hindmost</td></tr>
 <tr><td>late</td> <td>later, latter</td> <td>latest, last</td></tr>
 <tr><td>little</td> <td>less</td> <td>least</td></tr>
 <tr><td>much, many</td> <td>more</td> <td>most</td></tr>
 <tr><td>old</td> <td>older, elder</td> <td>oldest, eldest</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>Badly</i>
and <i>forth</i> may be used only as adverbs. <i>Well</i> is usually
an adverb; as, <i>He talks well</i>, but may be used as an adjective;
as, <i>He seems well</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>38. Confusion of Adjectives and Adverbs.</b> An adjective is
often used where an adverb is required, and vice versa. The sentence,
<i>She talks <b>foolish</b></i>, is wrong, because here the word
to be modified is <i>talks</i>, and since <i>talks</i> is a verb,
the adverb <i>foolishly</i> should be used. The sentence, <i>She
looks <b>charmingly</b></i>, means, as it stands, that her manner
of looking at a thing is charming. What is intended to be said is
that she appears as if she was a charming woman. To convey that
meaning, the adjective, <i>charming</i>, should have been used,
and the sentence should read, <i>She looks charming</i>. Wherever
the word modifies a verb or an adjective or another adverb, an
adverb should be used, and wherever the word, whatever its location
in the sentence, modifies a noun or pronoun, an adjective should
be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>39.</b> The adjective and the adverb are sometimes alike in
form. Thus, both the following sentences are correct: <i>He works
<b>hard</b></i> (adverb), and <i>His work is <b>hard</b></i>
(adjective). But, usually, where the adjective and the adverb correspond
at all, the adverb has the additional ending <i>ly</i>; as, <i>The
track is <b>smooth</b></i>, (adjective), and <i>The train runs
<b>smoothly</b></i>, (adverb).

<p class="indent">
<b>41. Errors in comparison</b> are frequently made. Observe carefully
the following rules:
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_37"><span class="page">Page 37</span></a> 1. The
superlative should not be used in comparing only two things. One
should say, <i>He is the <b>larger</b> of the two</i>, not <i>He
is the <b>largest</b> of the two</i>. But, <i>He is the largest
of the three</i>, is right.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. A comparison should not be attempted by adjectives that express
absolute quality&mdash;adjectives that cannot be compared; as,
<i>round, perfect, equally, universal</i>. A thing may be <i>round</i>
or <i>perfect</i>, but it cannot be <i>more round</i> or <i>most
round</i>, <i>more perfect</i> or <i>most perfect</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. When two objects are used in the comparative, one must not be
included in the other; but, when two objects are used in the
superlative, one must be included in the other. It is wrong to
say, <i>The discovery of America was <b>more important than any</b>
geographical discovery</i>, for that is saying that the discovery of
America was more important than itself&mdash;an absurdity. But it
would be right to say, <i>The discovery of America was more important
<b>than any other</b> geographical discovery</i>. One should not
say, <i>He is the most honest <b>of his</b> fellow-workmen</i>,
for he is not one of his fellow-workmen. One should say, <i>He is
more honest <b>than any</b> of his fellow-workmen</i>, or, <i>He
is the most honest <b>of all</b> the workmen</i>. To say, <i>This
machine is <b>better than any</b> machine</i>, is incorrect, but to
say, <i>This machine is better <b>than any other</b> machine</i>,
is correct. To say, <i>This machine is the <b>best of any</b>
machine</i> (or <i>any other machine</i>), is wrong, because all
machines are meant, not one machine or some machines. To say, <i>This
machine is the <b>best of</b> machines</i> (or <i>the best of all
machines</i>), is correct.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Note the following rules in regard to the use of <i>other</i> in
comparisons:
</p>

<p class="indent">
a. After comparatives followed by <i>than</i> the words <i>any</i>
and <i>all</i> should be followed by <i>other</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
b. After superlatives followed by <i>of, any</i> and <i>other</i>
should not be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. Avoid mixed comparisons. <i>John is as good, if not better than
she</i>. If the clause, <i>if not better</i>, were left out, this
<a name="page_38"><span class="page">Page 38</span></a> sentence
would read, <i>John is as good than she</i>. It could be corrected
to read, <i>John is as good <b>as</b>, if not better than she</i>.
Similarly, it is wrong to say, <i>He is one of the greatest, if
not the greatest, man in history</i>.

<b>42. Singular and Plural Adjectives.</b> Some adjectives can
be used only with singular nouns and some only with plural nouns.
Such adjectives as <i>one, each, every</i>, etc., can be used only
with singular nouns. Such adjectives as <i>several, various, many,
sundry, two</i>, etc., can be used only with plural nouns. In many
cases, the noun which the adjective modifies is omitted, and the
adjective thus acquires the force of a pronoun; as, <i><b>Few</b>
are seen, <b>Several</b> have come</i>.

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_40"><span class="page">Page 40</span></a> The adjective
pronouns <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> have plural forms, <i>these</i>
and <i>those</i>. The plurals must be used with plural nouns. To

<b>46. Double Negatives.</b> <i>I am here</i> is called an affirmative
statement. A denial of that, <i>I am not here</i>, is called a
negative statement. The words, <i>not, neither, never, none,
nothing</i>, etc., are all negative words; that is, they serve to
make denials of statements.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Two negatives should never be used in the same sentence, since
the effect is then to deny the negative you wish to assert, and an
affirmative is made where a negative is intended. <i>We haven't no
books</i>, means that we have some books. The proper negative form
would be, <i>We have no books</i>, or <i>We haven't any books</i>.
The mistake occurs usually where such forms as <i>isn't, don't,
haven't</i>, etc., are used. Examine the following sentences:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: <i>It isn't no</i> use.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: There <i>don't none</i> of them

   <i>nothing</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<i>Hardly, scarcely, only</i>, and <i>but</i> (in the sense of
<i>only</i>) are often incorrectly used with a negative. Compare
the following right and wrong forms:

<b>47. The Articles</b>. <i>A, an</i>, and <i>the</i>, are called
Articles. <i>A</i> and <i>an</i> are called the <b>Indefinite
Articles</b>, because they are used to limit the noun to any one
thing of a class; as, <i>a book, a chair</i>. But <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>
is not used to denote the whole of that <a name="page_44"><span
class="page">Page 44</span></a> class; as, <i>Silence is golden</i>,
or, <i>He was elected to the office of President</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>The</i> is called the <b>Definite Article</b> because it picks
out some one definite individual from a class.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the sentence, <i>On the street are <b>a</b> brick and <b>a</b>
stone house</i>, the article is repeated before each adjective;
the effect of this repetition is to make the sentence mean two
houses. But, in the sentence, <i>On the street is <b>a</b> brick
and stone house</i>, since the article is used only before the
first of the two adjectives, the sentence means that there is only
one house and that it is constructed of brick and stone.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where two nouns refer to the same object, the article need appear
only before the first of the two; as, <i>God, the author and creator
of the universe</i>. But where the nouns refer to two different
objects, regarded as distinct from each other, the article should
appear before each; as, <i>He bought a horse and a cow</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>A</i> is used before all words except those beginning with a
vowel sound. Before those beginning with a vowel sound <i>an</i>
is used. If, in a succession of words, one of these forms could not
be used before all of the words, then the article must be repeated
before each. Thus, one should say, <i><b>An</b> ax, <b>a</b> saw,
and <b>an</b> adze</i> (not <i>An ax, saw and adze</i>), <i>made
up his outfit</i>. Generally it is better to repeat the article
in each case, whether or not it be the same.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Do not say, <i>kind of <b>a house</b></i>. Since <i>a house</i>
is singular, it can have but one kind. Say instead, a <i>kind of
house, a sort of man</i>, etc.

CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subtitle">VERBS</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>49.</b> A <b>Verb</b> has already been defined as a word stating
something about the subject. Verbs are inflected or changed to
indicate the time of the action as past, present, or future; as,
<i>I talk, I talked, I shall talk</i>, etc. Verbs also vary to
indicate completed or incompleted action; as, <i>I have talked,
I shall have talked</i>, etc. To these variations, which indicate
the time of the action, the name <b>Tense</b> is given.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The full verbal statement may consist of several words; as, <i>He
<b>may have gone</b> home</i>. Here the verb is <i>may have gone</i>.
The last word of such a verb phrase is called the <b>Principal
Verb</b>, and the other words the <b>Auxiliaries</b>. In the sentence
above, <i>go (gone)</i> is the principal verb, and <i>may</i> and
<i>have</i> are the auxiliaries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>50.</b> In constructing the full form of the verb or verb phrase
there are three distinct parts from which all other forms are made.
These are called the <b>Principal Parts</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The First Principal Part, since it is the part by which the verb
is referred to as a word, may be called the <b>Name-Form</b>. The
following are name-forms: <i>do, see, come, walk, pass</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Second Principal Part is called the <b>Past Tense</b>. It is
formed by adding <i>ed</i> to the name-form; as, <i>walked, pushed,
passed</i>. These verbs that add <i>ed</i> are called Regular Verbs.
The verb form is often entirely changed; as, <i>done (do), saw
(see), came (come)</i>. These verbs are called Irregular Verbs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Third Principal Part is called the <b>Past Participle</b>. It
is used mainly in expressing completed action or in the passive
voice. In regular verbs the past participle is the same in <a
name="page_47"><span class="page">Page 47</span></a> form as the
past tense. In irregular verbs it may differ entirely from both
the name-form and the past tense, or it may resemble one or both
of them. Examples: <i>done (do, did), seen (see, saw), come (come,
came), set (set, set)</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>51. The name-form</b>, when unaccompanied by auxiliaries, is
used with all subjects, except those in the third person singular,
to assert action in the present time or present tense; as, <i>I
go, We come, You see, Horses run</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The name-form is also used with various auxiliaries (<i>may, might,
can, must, will, should, shall</i>, etc.) to assert futurity,
determination, possibility, possession, etc. Examples: <i>I may
go, We shall come, You can see, Horses should run</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By preceding it with the word <i>to</i>, the name-form is used to
form what is called the <b>Present Infinitive</b>; as, <i>I wish
to go, I hope to see</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
What may be called the <b>s-form</b> of the verb, or the <b>singular</b>
form, is usually constructed by adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> to the
name-form. The s-form is used with singular subjects in the third
person; as, <i>He goes, She comes, It runs, The dog trots</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The s-form is found in the third personal singular of the present
tense. In other tenses, if present at all, the s-form is in the
auxiliary, where the present tense of the auxiliary is used to form
some other tense of the principal verb. Examples: <i>He has</i>
(present tense), <i>He has gone</i> (perfect tense), <i>He has
been seen</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some verbs have no s-form; as, <i>will, shall, may</i>. The verb
<i>be</i> has two irregular s-forms: <i>Is</i>, in the present
tense, and <i>was</i> in the past tense. The s-form of <i>have</i>
is <i>has</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>52.</b> The past tense always stands alone in the predicate;
i.&nbsp;e., <b>it should never be used with any auxiliaries</b>. To
use it so, however, is one of the most frequent errors in grammar.
The following are past tense forms: <i>went, saw, wore, tore</i>.
To say, therefore, <i>I have saw, I have went, It was tore, They
were wore</i>, would be grossly incorrect.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>53.</b> The third principal part, the past participle, on the
<a name="page_48"><span class="page">Page 48</span></a> other hand,
<b>can never be used as a predicate verb without an auxiliary</b>.
The following are distinctly past participle forms: <i>done, seen,
sung</i>, etc. One could not then properly say, <i>I seen, I done,
I sung</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The distinction as to use with and without auxiliaries applies, of
course, only to irregular verbs. In regular verbs, the past tense
and past participle are always the same, and so no error could
result from their confusion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The past participle is used to form the <i>Perfect Infinitives</i>;
as, <i>to have gone, to have seen, to have been seen</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>54.</b> The following is a list of the principal parts of the most
important irregular verbs. The list should be mastered thoroughly.
The student should bear in mind always that, <b>the past tense form
should never be used with an auxiliary</b>, and that <b>the past
participle form should never be used as a predicate verb without
an auxiliary</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In some instances verbs have been included in the list below which
are always regular in their forms, or which have both regular and
irregular forms. These are verbs for whose principal parts incorrect
forms are often used.

<b>55. Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.</b> A <b>Transitive Verb</b>
is one in which the action of the verb goes over to a receiver; <a
name="page_56"><span class="page">Page 56</span></a> as, <i>He
<b>killed</b> the horse, I <b>keep</b> my word</i>. In both these
sentences, the verb serves to transfer the action from the subject to
the object or receiver of the action. The verbs in these sentences,
and all similar verbs, are transitive verbs. All others, in which
the action does not go to a receiver, are called <b>Intransitive
Verbs</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>56. Active and Passive Voice.</b> The <b>Active Voice</b> represents
the subject as the doer of the action; as, <i>I tell, I see, He
makes chairs</i>. The <b>Passive Voice</b> represents the subject
as the receiver of the action; as, <i>I am told, I am seen, I have
been seen, Chairs are made by me</i>. Since only transitive verbs
can have a receiver of the action, only transitive verbs can have
both active and passive voice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>57.</b> There are a few special verbs in which the failure to
distinguish between the transitive and the intransitive verbs leads
to frequent error. The most important of these verbs are the following:
<i>sit, set, awake, wake, lie, lay, rise, arise, raise, fell</i>,
and <i>fall</i>. Note again the principal parts of these verbs:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <tr><td>wake (to rouse another)</td><td>woke, waked</td>
     <td>woke, waked</td></tr>
 <tr><td>awake (to cease to sleep)</td><td>awoke, awaked</td>
     <td>awaked</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>fell (to strike down)</td><td>felled</td>
     <td>felled</td></tr>
 <tr><td>fall (to topple over)</td><td>fell</td>
     <td>fallen</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>lay (to place)</td><td>laid</td><td>laid</td></tr>
 <tr><td>lie (to recline)</td><td>lay</td><td>lain</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>raise (to cause to ascend)</td><td>raised</td>
     <td>raised</td></tr>
 <tr><td>(a)rise (to ascend)</td><td>(a)rose</td>
     <td>(a)risen</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td>set (to place)</td><td>set</td><td>set</td></tr>
 <tr><td>sit (to rest)</td><td>sat</td><td>sat</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
The first of each pair of the above verbs is transitive, and the
second is intransitive. Only the first, then, of each pair can
have an object or can be used in the passive voice.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_57"><span class="page">Page 57</span></a> NOTES.&mdash;The
following exceptions in the use of <i>sit</i> and <i>set</i> are,
by reason of usage, regarded as correct: <i>The sun sets, The moon
sets, They sat themselves down to rest</i>, and <i>He set out for
Chicago</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Lie</i>, meaning to deceive, has for its principal parts, <i>lie,
lied, lied. Lie</i>, however, with this meaning is seldom confused with
<i>lie</i> meaning to recline. The present participle of <i>lie</i>
is <i>lying</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Compare the following sentences, and note the reasons why the second
form in each case is the correct form.
</p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">WRONG</td>

<b>58. Mode.</b> Mode is that form of the verb which indicates
the manner in which the action or state is to be regarded. There
are several modes in English, but only between the indicative and
subjunctive modes is the distinction important. Generally speaking,
the <b>Indicative Mode</b> is used when the statement is regarded
as a fact or as truth, and the <b>Subjunctive Mode</b> is used
when the statement expresses uncertainty or implies some degree
of doubt.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>59. Forms of the Subjunctive.</b> The places in which the subjunctive

used only as an example of the conjunctions on which the subjunctive
depends. Other conjunctions may be used, or the verb may precede
the subject.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note.</span>&mdash;It
will be noticed that <i>thou art</i> and <i>thou wast</i>, etc.,
have been used in the second person singular. Strictly speaking,
these are the proper forms to be used here, even though <i>you
are</i> and <i>you were</i>, etc., are customarily used in
addressing a single person.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the subjunctive of <i>be</i>, it will be noted that the form
<i>be</i> is used throughout the present tense; and the form <i>were</i>
throughout the past tense.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In other verbs the subjunctive, instead of having the s-form in
the third person singular of the present tense, has the name-form,
or the same form as all the other forms of the present tense; as,
indicative, <i>he runs, she sees, it seems, he has;</i> subjunctive,
<i>if he run, though she see, lest it seem, if he have</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note.</span>&mdash;An
examination of the model conjugations under <b>&sect;77</b> will
give a further understanding of the forms of the subjunctive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>60. Use of Indicative and Subjunctive.</b> The indicative mode
would be properly used in the following sentence, when the statement
is regarded as true: <i>If that evidence is true, then he is a
criminal</i>. Similarly: <i>If he is rich, he ought to be
charitable</i>. Most directly declarative statements are put in
the indicative mode.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But when the sense of the statement shows uncertainty in the speaker's
mind, or shows that the condition stated is regarded as contrary to
fact or as untrue, the subjunctive is used. Note the two sentences
following, in which the conditions are properly in the subjunctive:
<i>If those statements be true, then all statements are true, Were
I rich, I might be charitable</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The subjunctive is usually preceded by the conjunctions, <i>if,
though, lest, although</i>, or the verb precedes the subject. But
it must be borne in mind that these do not always indicate the
subjunctive mode. <b>The use of the subjunctive depends on <a
name="page_63"><span class="page">Page 63</span></a> whether the
condition is regarded as a fact or as contrary to fact, certain
or uncertain.</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
It should be added that the subjunctive is perhaps going out of
use; some of the best writers no longer use its forms. This passing
of the subjunctive is to be regretted and to be discouraged, since
its forms give opportunity for many fine shades of meaning.

<b>61. Agreement of Verb with its Subject. The verb should agree
with its subject in person and number.</b> The most frequent error
is the failure of the verb to agree in number with its subject.
Singular subjects are used with plural verbs, and plural subjects
with singular verbs. These errors arise chiefly from a misapprehension
of the true number of the subject.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The s-form of the verb is the only distinct singular form, and
occurs only in the third person, singular, present indicative; as,
<i>He runs, she goes, it moves</i>. <i>Is, was</i>, and <i>has</i>
are the singular forms of the auxiliaries. <i>Am</i> is used only
with a subject in the first person, and is not a source of confusion.
The other auxiliaries have no singular forms.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Failure of the verb and its subject to agree in person seldom occurs,
and so can cause little confusion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Examine the following correct forms of agreement of verb and subject:
</p>

<p class="indent">
A barrel of clothes <b>was</b> shipped (not <i>were shipped</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
A man and a woman <b>have</b> been here (not <i>has been here</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Boxes <b>are</b> scarce (not <i>is scarce</i>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
When <b>were</b> the brothers here (not <i>when was</i>)?
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_65"><span class="page">Page 65</span></a> <b>62.
Agreement of Subject and Verb in Number.</b> The general rule to
be borne in mind in regard to number, is that <b>it is the meaning
and not the form of the subject that determines whether to use
the singular or the plural form of the verb.</b> This rule also
applies to the use of singular or plural pronouns.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many nouns plural in form are singular in meaning; as, <i>politics,
measles, news</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many, also, are treated as plurals, though in meaning they are singular;
as, <i>forceps, tongs, trousers</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some nouns, singular in form, are, according to the sense in which,
they are used, either singular or plural in meaning; as, <i>committee,
family, pair, jury, assembly, means</i>. The following sentences are
all correct: <i>The assembly has closed its meeting, The assembly
are all total abstainers, The whole family is a famous one, The
whole family are sick</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the use of the adjective pronouns, <i>some, each</i>, etc., the
noun is often omitted. When this is done, error is often made by
using the wrong number of the verb. <i>Each, either, neither, this,
that</i>, and <i>one</i>, when used alone as subjects, require singular
verbs. <i>All, those, these, few, many</i>, always require plural
verbs. <i>Any, none</i>, and <i>some</i> may take either singular
or plural verbs. In most of these cases, as is true throughout the
subject of agreement in number, reason will determine the form
to be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some nouns in a plural form express quantity rather than number.
When quantity is plainly intended the singular verb should be used.
Examine the following sentences; each is correct: <i>Three drops
of medicine is a dose, Ten thousand tons of coal was purchased by
the firm, Two hundred dollars was the amount of the collection,
Two hundred silver dollars were in the collection</i>.

<b>63. The following rules govern the agreement of the verb with
a compound subject:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. When a singular noun is modified by two adjectives so as to
mean two distinct things, the verb should be in the plural; as,
<i>French and German literature <b>are</b> studied.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. When the verb applies to the different parts of the compound
subject, the plural form of the verb should be used; as, <i>John
and Harry <b>are</b> still to come.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. When the verb applies to one subject and not to the others,
it should agree with that subject to which it applies; as, <i>The
employee, and not the employers, <b>was</b> to blame, The employers,
and not the employee, <b>were</b> to blame, The boy, as well as
his sisters, <b>deserves</b> praise.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. When the verb applies separately to several subjects, each in
the singular, the verb should be singular; as, <i>Each book and
each paper <b>was</b> in its place, No help and no hope <b>is</b>
found for him, Either one or the other <b>is</b> he, Neither one
nor the other <b>is</b> he.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. When the verb applies separately to several subjects, some of
which are singular and some plural, it should agree with the subject
nearest to it; as, <i>Neither the boy, nor his sisters <b>deserve</b>
praise, Neither the sisters nor the boy <b>deserves</b> praise.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
6. When a verb separates its subjects, it should agree with the
first; as, <i>The leader <b>was</b> slain and all his men, The
men <b>were</b> slain, and also the leader.</i>
</p>

<b>64. Some miscellaneous cautions in regard to agreement in number:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Do not use a plural verb after a singular subject modified by
an adjective phrase; as, <i>The thief, with all his booty, was
captured</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. Do not use a singular form of the verb after <i>you</i> and
<i>they</i>. Say: <i>You were, they are, they were</i>, etc., not,
<i>you was, they was,</i> etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. Do not mistake a noun modifier for the noun subject. In the
sentence, <i>The <b>sale</b> of boxes was increased, sale</i>, not
<i>boxes</i>, is the subject of the verb.
</p>

<p class="indent">
4. When the subject is a relative pronoun, the number and the person
of the antecedent determine the number and the person of the verb.
Both of the following sentences are correct: <i>He is the only
one of the men <b>that is</b> to be trusted, He is one of those
men <b>that are</b> to be trusted.</i> It is to be remembered that
the singulars and the plurals of the relative pronouns are alike
in form; <i>that, who</i>, etc., may refer to one or more than
one.
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. Do not use incorrect contractions of the verb with <i>not</i>.
<i>Don't</i> cannot be used with <i>he</i> or <i>she</i> or <i>it</i>,
or with any other singular subject in the third person. One should
say, <i>He doesn't</i>, not <i>he don't; it doesn't</i>, not <i>it
don't; man doesn't</i>, not <i>man don't</i>. The proper form of
the verb that is being contracted in these instances is <i>does</i>,
not <i>do</i>. <i>Ain't</i> and <i>hain't</i> are always wrong;
no such contractions are recognized. Such colloquial contractions
as <i>don't, can't</i>, etc., should not be used at all in formal
composition.

<b>70. Participles and Gerunds.</b> The past participle has already
been mentioned as one of the principal parts of the verb. Generally,
the <b>participles</b> are those forms of the verb that <b>are used
adjectively;</b> as, <i>seeing, having seen, being seen, having
been seen, seen, playing, having played</i>, etc. In the following
sentences note that the verb form in each case modifies a substantive:
<i>He, <b>having been invited to dine</b>, came early, John, <b>being
sick</b>, could not come</i>. The verb form in all these cases is
called a participle, and must be used in connection with either
a nominative or objective case of a noun or pronoun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Gerund</b> is the same as the participle in its forms, but
differs in that, while the participle is always used adjectively,
the <b>gerund is always used substantively</b>; as, <i>I told <b>of
his winning</b> the race, <b>After his asserting</b> it, I believe
the statement</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>71. Misuses of Participles and Gerunds.</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. A participle should not be used unless it stands in a grammatical
and logical relation to some substantive that is present in the
sentence. Failure to follow this rule leads to the error known
as the "dangling participle." It is wrong to say, <i>The dish was
broken, <b>resulting</b> from its fall</i>, because <i>resulting</i>
does not stand in grammatical relation to any word in the sentence.
But it would be right to say, <i>The dish was <a name="page_81"><span
class="page">Page 81</span></a> broken as a result of its fall</i>.
Examine, also, the following examples:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: I spent a week in Virginia,
      <i>followed</i> by a week at Atlantic City.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: I spent a week in Virginia,
      <i>following</i> it by a week at Atlantic City.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: I spent a week in Virginia,
      <i>and then</i> a week at Atlantic City.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
2. A participle should not stand at the beginning of a sentence or
principal clause unless it belongs to the subject of that sentence
or clause. Compare the following:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: Having been sick, it was decided to
      remain at home.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: Having been sick, I decided to
      remain at home.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
3. A participle preceded by <i>thus</i> should not be used unless
it modifies the subject of the preceding verb. Compare the following:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: He had to rewrite several pages,
   <i>thus causing</i> him a great deal of trouble.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: He had to rewrite several pages,
   <i>and was thus caused</i> a great deal of trouble.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: He had to rewrite several pages,
   <i>thus experiencing</i> a great deal of trouble.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
4. The gerund is often used as the object of a preposition, and
frequently has a noun or pronoun modifier. Owing to confusion between
the gerund and the participle, and to the failure to realize that
the gerund can only be used substantively, the objective case of a
modifying noun or pronoun is often wrongly used before the gerund.
A substantive used with the gerund should always be in the possessive
case. Say, <i>I heard <b>of John's coming</b></i>, not, <i>I heard
<b>of John coming</b></i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
5. When a gerund and a preposition are used, the phrase should
be in logical and immediate connection with the substantive it
modifies, and the phrase should never introduce a sentence unless
it logically belongs to the subject of that <a name="page_82"><span
class="page">Page 82</span></a> sentence. Exception: When the gerund
phrase denotes a general action, it may be used without grammatical
connection to the sentence; as, <i>In traveling, good drinking water
is essential</i>. Compare the following wrong and right forms:
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: <i>After seeing his mistake</i>, a
      new start was made.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: <i>After seeing his mistake</i>, he
      made a new start.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: <i>By writing rapidly, the work</i>
      can be finished.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: <i>By writing rapidly, you</i> can
      finish the work.</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: <i>In copying the exercise</i>, a
      mistake was made.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: <i>In copying the exercise, I</i>
      made a mistake.</td></tr>

<b>72. Infinitives.</b> The Infinitives are formed by the word
<i>to</i> and some part of the verb or of the verb and auxiliary.
For <i>see</i> and <i>play</i> as model verbs, the infinitives
are as follows:
</p>

<table class="indent">
<tr><td>PRESENT ACTIVE</td>
    <td>PRESENT PASSIVE</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">to see</td>
    <td style="padding-left: 2em;">to be seen</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">to play</td>
    <td style="padding-left: 2em;">to be played</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRESENT PERFECT ACTIVE</td>

<tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">to have seen</td>
    <td style="padding-left: 2em;">to have been seen</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">to have played</td>
    <td style="padding-left: 2em;">to have been played</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_84"><span class="page">Page 84</span></a> The word
<i>to</i> is frequently omitted. In general, other verbs follow
the same endings and forms as do the infinitives above.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is necessary to know the difference between the two tenses, since
the misuse of tenses leads to a certain class of errors.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>73. Sequence of Infinitive Tenses.</b> The wrong tense of the
infinitive is frequently used. The following rules should be observed:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. If the action referred to by the infinitive is of the same time
or of later time than that indicated by the predicate verb, the
<b>present infinitive</b> should be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. When the action referred to by the infinitive is regarded as
completed at the time indicated by the predicate verb, the <b>perfect

<b>74. Split Infinitives.</b> In the sentence, care should be taken
to avoid as much as possible the inserting of an adverb or an adverbial
modifier between the parts of the infinitive. This error is called
the "split infinitive." Compare the following:

<b>76. Omission of the Verb or Parts of the Verb.</b> The verb

makes the sentence ungrammatical or doubtful in its meaning.

CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">CONNECTIVES: RELATIVE PRONOUNS, RELATIVE ADVERBS,
CONJUNCTIONS, AND PREPOSITIONS</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>78. Independent and Dependent Clauses.</b> A sentence may consist
of two or more independent clauses, or it may consist of one principal
clause and one or more dependent clauses.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Independent clauses</b> are joined by conjunctions; such as,
<i>hence, but, and, although</i>, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Dependent clauses</b> are joined to the sentence by relative
adverbs; such as, <i>where, when</i>, etc., or by relative pronouns;
as, <i>who, what</i>, etc. These dependent clauses may have the
same office in the sentence as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, or
adverbs. (See <b>&sect;7</b>.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>79. Case and Number of Relative and Interrogative Pronouns.</b>
Failure to use the proper case and number of the relative pronouns
has already been touched upon (see <b>&sect;29</b>), but a further
mention of this fault may well be made here.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The relative pronoun has other offices in the sentence than that
of connecting the dependent and principal clauses. It may serve
as a subject or an object in the clause. The sentence, <i>I wonder
<b>whom</b> will be chosen</i>, is wrong, because the relative
here is the subject of <i>will be chosen</i>, not the object of
<i>wonder</i>, and should have the nominative form <i>who</i>.
Corrected, it reads, <i>I wonder <b>who</b> will be chosen</i>.
Examine the following sentences:
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: We know <i>who</i> we mean.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: We know <i>whom</i> we mean.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: You may give it to <i>whoever</i>
   you wish.
   <a name="page_102"><span class="page">Page 102</span></a>
   </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: You may give it to <i>whomever</i>
   you wish.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: Do you know <i>whom</i> it is?</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: Do you know <i>who</i> it is?
      (Attribute complement.)</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Wrong: Everybody <i>who were</i> there were
      disappointed. (Disagreement in number.)</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Right: Everybody <i>who was</i> there was
      disappointed.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
The relative pronoun takes the case required by the clause it
introduces, not the case required by any word preceding it. Thus,
the sentence, <i>He gave it to <b>who</b> had the clearest right</i>,
is correct, because <i>who</i> is the subject of the verb <i>had</i>,
and therefore in the nominative case. <i>Give it to <b>whomever</b>
they name</i>, is right, because <i>whomever</i> is the object of
<i>they name</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Errors in the use of interrogative pronouns are made in the same
way as in the use of the relatives. The interrogative pronoun has
other functions besides making an interrogation. It serves also as
the subject or object in the sentence. Care must be taken, then,
to use the proper case. Say, <i>Whom are you looking for?</i> not,
<i>Who are you looking for?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note.</span> Some
writers justify the use of <i>who</i> in sentences like
the last one on the ground that it is an idiom. When, as in this
book, the object is training in grammar, it is deemed better to
adhere to the strictly grammatical form.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>80. Conjunctive or Relative Adverbs.</b> It is better to use
a <b><i>when</i> clause</b> only in the subordinate part of the
sentence, to state the time of an event. Compare the following:

</table>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_104"><span class="page">Page 104</span></a> <b>81.</b>
Do not use a <i><b>when</b></i> or a <b><i>where</i> clause</b>
in defining a subject or in place of a predicate noun.
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Bad: Commencement is when one formally

<b>82.</b> <i>So, then</i>, and <i>also</i>, the conjunctive adverbs,

<a name="page_105"><span class="page">Page 105</span></a>
<b>83. Conjunctions.</b> There are certain conjunctions, and also
certain pairs of conjunctions that frequently cause trouble.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>And</b> or <b>but</b> should not be used to join a dependent
clause to an independent clause; as, <i>It was a new valise <b>and</b>
differing much from his old one</i>. Say instead, <i>It was a new
valise, differing much from his old one</i>, or <i>It was a new
valise, and differed very much from his old one</i>. Similarly, <i>It
was a new book <b>which</b></i> (not <i>and which</i>) <i>interested
him very much</i>. This "and which" construction is a frequent
error; <i>and which</i> should never be used unless there is more
than one relative clause, and then never with the first one.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>But</b> or <b>for</b> should not be used to introduce both of
two succeeding statements. Both of the following sentences are bad
by reason of this error: <i>He likes geometry, <b>but</b> fails in
algebra, <b>but</b> studies it hard, He read all night, <b>for</b>
the book interested him, <b>for</b> it was along the line of his
ambition</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Than</b> and <b>as</b> should not be followed by objective pronouns
in sentences like this: <i>I am as large <b>as him</b></i>. The
verb in these sentences is omitted. If it is supplied, the error
will be apparent. The sentence would then read, <i>I am as large
as <b>him</b> (is large)</i>. The correct form is, <i><b>I</b> am
as large as he (is large)</i>. Similarly, <i>He is taller than
<b>I</b> (am tall), She is brighter than <b>he</b> (is bright)</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>As</b> may be used as either a conjunction or an adverb. <i>He
is <b>as</b> tall <b>as I</b></i>. The first <i>as</i> is an adverb,
the second <i>as</i> is a conjunction. <i>As</i> is properly used
as an adverb when the equality is asserted, but, when the equality
is denied, <i>so</i> should be used in its place. <i>He is <b>as</b>
old <b>as I</b></i>, is correct, but the denial should be, <i>He is
<b>not so</b> old <b>as I</b></i>. After <i>not</i> do not use <i>as</i>
when <i>as</i> is an adverb.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Neither</b>, when used as a conjunction, should be followed
by <b>nor</b>; as, <i>Neither he <b>nor</b> (not or) I can come.
Neither</i> should never be followed by <i>or</i>.

<p class="indent">
<b>Either</b>, when used as a conjunction, should be followed by
<b>or</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>84. Placing of Correlatives</b>. The correlatives, such as
<i>neither&mdash;nor, either&mdash;or, not only&mdash;but also</i>,
should be placed in clear relation to similar parts of speech or
similar parts <a name="page_106"><span class="page">Page 106</span></a>

other toward some other part of speech.

CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">SENTENCES</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>87.</b> Classified as to their rhetorical construction, sentences
are considered as loose, periodic, and balanced.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The <b>Loose Sentence</b> is so constructed that it may be closed
at two or more places and yet make complete sense; as,
</p>

<p class="indent">
Napoleon felt his <i>weakness</i>, and tried to win back popular
<i>favor</i> by concession after <i>concession</i>, until, at his
fall, he had nearly restored parliamentary <i>government</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Note that this sentence could be closed after the words. <i>weakness,
favor</i>, and <i>concession</i>, as well as after <i>government</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>88.</b> The <b>Periodic Sentence</b> holds the complete thought
in suspense until the close of the sentence. Compare the following
periodic sentence with the loose sentence under <b>&sect;87:</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Napoleon, feeling his weakness, and trying to win back popular favor
by concession after concession, had, at his fall, nearly restored
parliamentary government.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both loose and periodic sentences are proper to use, but, since
periodic sentences demand more careful and definite thought, the
untrained writer should try to use them as much as possible.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>89.</b> The <b>Balanced Sentence</b> is made up of parts similar
in form, but often contrasted in meaning; as, <i>He is a man; Jones
is a gentleman.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>90. Sentence Length.</b> As to the length of the sentence there is
no fixed rule. Frequently, sentences are too long, and are, in their
thought, involved and hard to follow. On the other hand, if there is
a succession of short sentences, choppiness <a name="page_118"><span

One should carefully examine sentences which contain more than
thirty or thirty-five words to see that they are clear in their
meaning and accurate in their construction.

<li>In highly developed commercial communities banks cannot afford
space in their vaults for valuables. Especially, they cannot afford
it merely to accommodate their patrons. Hence, in such communities
the furnishing of places for safe deposit has become a separate
business.</li>

<li>History should be a part of the course in all schools. It develops
the memory. It furnishes the explanation of many social phenomena.
It broadens the intellectual view. It gives culture as no other
study can give it.</li>

<li>He never desired a higher education. This was possible because
of the money bequeathed to him by his father. It had left him no
need for a great earning capacity. More likely, it was because
of the inborn dulness and lethargy of his mind.</li>

<li>New York is the pivotal state in all national elections. Its

<b>91.</b> The essential qualities that a sentence should possess,
aside from correctness, are those of Unity, Coherence, Emphasis,

</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Unity.</b> Unity demands that the sentence deal with but one
general thought, and that it deal with it in such a consistent
and connected manner that the thought is clearly and effectively
presented. Unity demands, also, that closely related thoughts should
not be improperly scattered among several sentences.
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Statements having no necessary relation to one another should
not be embodied in one sentence.

<b>93. Emphasis.</b> Emphasis demands that the sentence be so arranged
that the principal idea shall be brought into prominence and the
minor details subordinated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. Avoid weak beginnings and weak endings in the sentence.
</p>

2. A change from the normal order often makes a great change in
emphasis.

   tree not far back of our camp.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Changed: From a thick tree not far back of

   living things were destroyed.</td></tr>

CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE PARAGRAPH</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>141.</b> The <b>Paragraph</b> is a connected series of sentences
all dealing with the development of a single topic. Where the general
subject under discussion is very narrow, the paragraph may constitute
the whole composition; but usually, it forms one of a number of
subtopics, each dealing with some subdivision of the general subject.
For each one of these subtopics a separate paragraph should be
made.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The purpose of the paragraph is to aid the reader to comprehend
the thought to be expressed. The paragraph groups in a logical way
the different ideas to be communicated. It gives rest to the eye
of the reader, and makes clearer the fact that there is a change
of topic at each new paragraph.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>142. Paragraph Length.</b> There is no fixed rule governing the
proper length of the paragraph, but, probably, no paragraph need
be more than three hundred words in length. If the whole composition
is not more than two hundred and fifty words in length, it will
not often need to be subdivided into paragraphs. In a letter,
paragraphing should be more frequent than in other compositions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Paragraphing should not be too frequent. If paragraphing is too
frequent, by making each minute subdivision of equal importance,
it defeats its purpose of grouping ideas about some general topic.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>143.</b> Sometimes a sentence or even a part of a sentence may be
set off as a separate paragraph in order to secure greater emphasis.
This, however, is only using the paragraph for a proper purpose&mdash;to
aid in gaining clearness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_149"><span class="page">Page 149</span></a> <b>144.
Paragraphing of Speech.</b> In a narrative, each direct quotation,
together with the rest of the sentence of which it is a part, should
constitute a separate paragraph. This rule should be always followed
in writing a conversation. Examine the following:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
A certain Scotch family cherishes this anecdote of a trip which
Dr. Samuel Johnson made to Scotland. He had stopped at the house
of this family for a meal, and was helped to the national dish.
During the meal the hostess asked:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
"Dr. Johnson, what do you think of our Scotch broth?"
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
"Madam," was the answer, "in my opinion it is fit only for pigs."
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
"Then have some more," said the woman.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The only case in which the quoted words can be detached from the
remainder of the sentence is where they form the end of the sentence
after some introductory words, as in the second paragraph of the
example just given.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>145. Indentation of the Paragraph.</b> The first sentence of each
new paragraph should be indented. See example under <b>&sect;144</b>.
No other sentence should be so indented.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>146.</b> The essential qualities which each paragraph should
have are: Unity, Coherence, and Emphasis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Unity.</b> Unity requires that the paragraph should deal with
only one subject, and should include nothing which does not have a
direct bearing on that subject. Thus, in the following paragraph,
the italicized sentence violates the principle of Unity, because,
very obviously it belongs to some other paragraph:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Never did any race receive the Gospel with more ardent enthusiasm
than the Irish. <i>St. Patrick, a zealous priest, was thought to
have banished the snakes from the island</i>. So enthusiastic were
the Irish, that, not content with the religious work in Ireland,
the Irish Church sent out its missionaries to Scotland, to Germany,
and to the Alps and Apennines. It founded religious houses and
monasteries....
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_150"><span class="page">Page 150</span></a> Separate
paragraphs should not be made of matter which belongs together. If
the ideas can all be fairly included under one general topic, unity
demands that they be grouped in one paragraph. Thus, in describing the
route followed in a certain journey, one should not use a separate
paragraph for each step in the journey.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Wrong:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
In returning to the University, I went from Pittsburgh to Cleveland.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Then I took a berth for the night on one of the lake steamers running
from Cleveland to Detroit.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
From Detroit I completed the journey to Ann Arbor on an early train
the next morning.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If unity is to be secured, not only must all the ideas brought
out in the paragraph deal with the same topic, but also, they must
be developed in some consistent, systematic order. A certain point
of view should be generally maintained as to tense, subject, and
manner of expression.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>147. How to Gain Unity.</b> Careful thought before beginning
the paragraph is necessary if unity is to be gained. The topic of
the paragraph should be determined, and should be clearly indicated
by a topic sentence. Usually this topic sentence should be placed
near the beginning of the paragraph. The first sentence is the
clearest and best place for it. The topic sentence need not be a
formal statement of the subject to be discussed, but may be any
sentence that shows what is to be the central idea of the paragraph.
</p>

<p class="indent">
With the topic determined, there are various ways of developing it.
It may be developed by repetition; by adding details and specific
instances to the general statement; by presenting proof; by
illustration; or by showing cause or effect.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>148.</b> Examine the following paragraphs. Each possesses the
quality of unity. The topic sentence in each case is italicized.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<a name="page_151"><span class="page">Page 151</span></a> <i>To rule
was not enough for Bonaparte.</i> He wanted to amaze, to dazzle,
to overpower men's souls, by striking, bold, magnificent, and
unanticipated results. To govern ever so absolutely would not have
satisfied him, if he must have governed silently. He wanted to
reign through wonder and awe, by the grandeur and terror of his
name, by displays of power which would rivet on him every eye, and
make him the theme of every tongue. Power was his supreme object;
but power which should be gazed at as well as felt, which should
strike men as a prodigy, which should shake old thrones as an
earthquake, and, by the suddenness of its new creations, should
awaken something of the submissive wonder which miraculous agency
inspires.
</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: right;">
From <i>The Character of Napoleon Bonaparte</i>, by Channing.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>There is something in the very season of the year that gives a
charm to the festivity of Christmas.</i> At other times we derive
a great portion of our pleasures from the mere beauties of Nature.
Our feelings sally forth and dissipate themselves over the sunny
landscape and we "live abroad and everywhere." The song of the bird,
the murmur of the stream, the breathing fragrance of spring, the
soft voluptuousness of summer, the golden pomp of autumn; earth with
its mantle of refreshing green, and heaven with its deep delicious
blue and its cloudy magnificence&mdash;all fill us with mute but
exquisite delight, and we revel in the luxury of mere sensation.
But in the depth of winter, when Nature lies despoiled of every
charm, and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn our
gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of
the landscape, the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they
circumscribe our wanderings, shut in also our feelings from rambling
abroad, and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasures of the
social circle. Our thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly
sympathies more aroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each
other's society, and are brought more closely together by dependence
on each other for enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart, and we draw
our pleasures from the deep wells of living kindness which lie in
the quiet recesses of our bosoms; and which, where resorted to,
furnish forth the pure element of domestic felicity.
</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: right;">
From <i>Christmas</i>, by Washington Irving.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>149. Coherence.</b> Coherence demands that each paragraph shall be
perfectly clear in its meaning, and that it be <a name="page_152"><span
class="page">Page 152</span></a> so constructed that it may be
readily grasped by the reader. The relation of sentence to sentence,
of idea to idea, must be clearly brought out. The whole fabric of
the paragraph must be woven together&mdash;it must not consist
of disconnected pieces.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>150. How to Gain Coherence.</b> Where vividness or some other
quality does not gain coherence in the sentence, it is usually
gained by the use of words or phrases which refer to or help to
keep in mind the effect of the preceding sentences, or which show
the bearing of the sentence on the paragraph topic. These words may
be of various sorts; as, <i>it, this view, however, in this way</i>,
etc. Sometimes the subject is repeated occasionally throughout the
paragraph, or is directly or indirectly indicated again at the
end of the paragraph.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Examine carefully the following selections. Note the italicized
words of coherence, and note in each case how they aid the flow
of thought from sentence to sentence, and help to keep in mind
the paragraph topic.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
I will give you my opinion and advice in regard to the <i>two books</i>
you have named. The <i>first</i> is interesting and easy to read.
<i>It</i> is, <i>also</i>, by no means lacking in the value of
the information it presents. <i>But the second</i>, while it is
no less interesting and equally valuable in its contents, seems
to me far more logical and scholarly in its construction. <i>In
addition to this</i> I think you will find it cheaper in price, by
reason of its not being so profusely illustrated. <i>Therefore</i>,
I should advise you to procure the <i>second</i> for your study.
<i>Either, indeed</i>, will do, but since you have a choice, take
the better one.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
A Husbandman who had a quarrelsome family, after having tried in
vain to reconcile them by words, thought he might more readily
prevail by an example. <i>So</i> he called his sons and bade them
lay a bundle of sticks before him. <i>Then having tied them</i>
up into a fagot, he told <i>the lads</i>, one after another, to
take it up and break it. <i>They all tried</i>, but tried in vain.
<i>Then</i>, untying <i>the fagot</i>, he gave <i>them</i> the
sticks to break one by one. <i>This</i> they did with the greatest
ease. <i>Then</i> said the father: "<i>Thus</i>, my sons, as long
as you remain united, <a name="page_153"><span class="page">Page
153</span></a> you are a match for all your enemies; but differ
and separate, and you are undone." <i>&AElig;sop's Fables</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Examine also the selections under <b>&sect;&sect; 205</b> and
<b>206</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>151. Emphasis.</b> The third quality which a paragraph should
possess is emphasis. The paragraph should be so constituted as
to bring into prominence the topic or the point it is intended
to present. The places of greatest emphasis are usually at the
beginning and at the end of the paragraph. In short paragraphs
sufficient emphasis is generally gained by having a topic sentence
at the beginning. In longer paragraphs it is often well to indicate
again the topic at the end by way of summary in order to impress
thoroughly on the reader the effect of the paragraph.

CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="subtitle">LETTER-WRITING</p>

<p class="indent">
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Note to
Teacher.</span>&mdash;For the purpose of training in composition,
in the more elementary work, letter-writing affords probably the
most feasible and successful means. Letter-writing does not demand
any gathering of material, gains much interest, and affords much
latitude for individual tastes in topics and expression. Besides,
letter-writing is the field in which almost all written composition
will be done after leaving school; and so all training in school
will be thoroughly useful. For this reason, it is suggested that
letter-writing be made one of the chief fields for composition
work.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In Exercise 75, are given a number of suggestions for letter-writing.
Others will readily occur to the teacher.
</p>

<p class="center_sc">
The Heading
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>152. Position of Heading.</b> In all business letters the writer's
address and the date of writing should precede the letter and be
placed at the upper right hand side of the sheet not less than an
inch from the top. This address and date is called the <b>heading</b>.
In friendly letters the parts of the heading are sometimes placed
at the end of the letter on the left side a short distance below
the body of the letter. This is permissible, but to place it at
the beginning in all letters is more logical and customary. Never
write part of the heading at the beginning and part at the end of
the letter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>153. Order of Heading.</b> The parts of the heading should be
sufficient to enable the accurate addressing of a reply, and should
be in the following order: (1) the street address, (2) the town or
the city address, (3) the date. If all cannot be easily placed on
one line, two or even three lines should be <a name="page_156"><span
class="page">Page 156</span></a> used; but, in no case, should the
above order be varied. Examples:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 1em;">Wrong:</td>
    <td>March 31, 1910, Red Oaks, Iowa, 210 Semple Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 1em;">Right:</td>

    <td>210 Semple Street,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 2em;">Red Oaks, Iowa,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 4em;">March 31, 1910.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
If only two lines are used, put the writer's address on the first
line and the date on the second.
</p>

<tr><td rowspan="2" style="padding-left: 1em;">Wrong:</td>
    <td>January 19, 1910, Sharon, Pennsylvania,</td></tr>

    <td>The Hotel Lafayette, Sharon, Pennsylvania,</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left: 8em;">January 19, 1910.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<b>154. Punctuation of Heading.</b> Place a period after each
abbreviation that is used. In addition to this, place commas after
the street address, after the town address, after the state address,
and after the number of the day of the month. Place a period after the
number of the year. Examine the correct address under <b>&sect;153</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>155. Faults to be Avoided in Headings.</b> Avoid the use of
abbreviations in the friendly letter, and avoid their too frequent
use in the business letter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is better to avoid abbreviating any but the longer names of states.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Avoid all such abbreviations as the following: <i>St.</i> for <i>Street;

The Inside Address
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>156. Position of Inside Address.</b> In strictly commercial
letters the name and the address of the person to whom the letter
is being sent should come at the beginning of the letter, and should
begin flush with the margin at the left side of the page, and a
little below the level of the heading. The second line of the inside
address should be set in a little from the margin. See model letters
under <b>&sect;174</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In formal friendly letters and in letters of a non-commercial nature,
the inside address should stand a little below the bottom of the

the inside address may be omitted.

<p class="indent">
<b>157. Punctuation of Inside Address.</b> In punctuating the inside
address, place a period after each abbreviation that is used. In
addition to this, place a comma after the name of the addressee,
a comma after the street address, if one be given, and after the
name of the town or city. Place a period after the name of the
state or country. Examine the correct inside address under

The Salutation
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>159. Position of Salutation.</b> The salutation should begin
flush with the margin and on the line next below the inside address.
See correctly written letters under <b>&sect;174</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>160. Form of Salutation.</b> The salutation varies with the form
of the letter and the relations between the writer and receiver of the
letter. Where the parties are strangers or mere business acquaintances
the most common salutations for individuals are, <i>Dear Sir, Dear
Madam</i>, or <i>My dear Sir, My dear Madam</i>. For a group of
persons, or for a company or a partnership, <i>Gentlemen, Dear
Sirs, Dear Madams</i> or <i>Mesdames</i> are used. In less formal
business letters such salutations as, <i>My dear Mr. Smith</i>, or
<i>Dear Miss Jaekel</i> may be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_160"><span class="page">Page 160</span></a> In the
case of informal and friendly letters, as in business and formal
letters, the salutation to be used is largely a matter of taste.
The following are illustrations of proper salutations for friendly
letters: <i>My dear Doctor, Dear Cousin, Dear Cousin Albert, Dear
Miss Jaekel, Dear Major, My dear Miss Smith, Dear William, Dear
Friend,</i> etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is considered more formal to prefix <i>My</i> to the salutation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is over formal to use simply <i>Sir</i> or <i>Madam</i> in any
letter, or to use <i>Dear Sir</i> or <i>Dear Madam</i> when writing
to a familiar friend.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If one uses a very familiar salutation, such as <i>Dear Brown,
Dear John,</i> etc., it is better to put the inside address at the
close of the letter, or to omit it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>161. Punctuation of Salutation.</b> Punctuate the salutation
with a colon, except in informal letters, when a comma may be used.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>162. Faults to be Avoided in the Salutation.</b> Use no abbreviations
except <i>Dr., Mr., Mrs.</i> Do not use the abbreviation <i>Dr.</i>,
when that title is used as a final word in a salutation.

The Body of the Letter
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>163. The Subject Matter of the Letter.</b> In friendly letters
much latitude is allowed in the body of the letter, but business
letters should be brief and to the point. No letter, however, should
be lacking in the courteous forms or in completeness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>164. Form of Body.</b> The body of the letter usually begins
on the line below the salutation and is indented the same distance
from the margin as any other paragraph would be indented. See model
letters under <b>&sect;174</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In commercial letters paragraph divisions are made more frequently
than in other composition. Each separate point should be made the
subject of a separate paragraph.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>165. Faults in Body of the Letter.</b> In letters that are intended
to be complete and formal, avoid the omission of articles, pronouns,
and prepositions. Avoid also expressions that are grammatically
incomplete. Only in extremely familiar and hasty letters should
the "telegraph style" be adopted.

<p class="indent">
Avoid the use of abbreviations in the letter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is well to avoid the too frequent use of the pronoun <i>I</i>
in the letter, though care must be taken not to carry this caution
to extremes. <i>I</i>, however, should not be omitted when necessary
to the completeness of the sentence. Do not try to avoid its use
by omitting it from the sentence, but by substituting a different
form of sentence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is no objection to beginning a letter with <i>I</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Punctuate the letter just as carefully as any other composition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Excepting in letters of a formal nature, there is no objection
to the use of colloquial expressions such as <i>can't, don't,</i>
etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Unless you have some clear reason to the contrary, avoid the use
of expressions that have been used so much that they are worn out
and often almost meaningless. Such expressions as the following ones
are not wrong, but are often used when they are both inappropriate
and unnecessary.
</p>

The Close
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>166. Final Words.</b> Business letters frequently close with
some final words, such as, <i>Thanking you again for your kind
assistance, I am ..., A waiting your further orders, we are</i>
..., etc. These expressions are not wrong, but are often used when
not at all necessary.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>167. The Complimentary Close.</b> The complimentary close should
be written on a separate line near the middle of the page, and
should begin with a capital letter. Appropriateness is the only
guide to the choice of a complimentary close.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following complimentary closes are proper for business letters:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 50%;">Yours respectfully,</td>
     <td>Yours very truly,</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Yours truly,</td><td>Very truly yours,</td></tr>

as, <i>Yrs. respy., yrs. try.,</i> etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>169. The Signature of the Writer.</b> The letter should be so
signed as to cause no doubt or embarrassment to any one addressing a
reply. The signature should show whether the <a name="page_164"><span
class="page">Page 164</span></a> writer is a man or a woman; and,
if a woman, it should indicate whether she is to be addressed as
<i>Miss</i> or <i>Mrs.</i> In formal letters it is customary for
a woman to indicate how she is to be addressed by signing her name
in the following manner:

Miscellaneous Directions
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>170.</b> In beginning the letter, place the address and date
an inch and a half or two inches below the top of the page.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Leave a margin of about a half inch or more on the left side of
the page. Indent the beginning of each paragraph about an inch
or more beyond the margin.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In using a four-page sheet, write on the pages in their order, 1,
2, 3, 4.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the correctly written forms of letters under <b>&sect;174</b>
observe the indentation of the lines. The first line of the inside
address should be flush with the margin, the second somewhat set
in. The salutation should begin flush with the margin. The body
of the letter should begin on the line below the salutation, and
some distance in from the margin.
</p>

<p class="center_sc">
The Outside Address
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>171. Position of Outside Address.</b> Place the address on the
envelope so that it balances well. Do not have it too far toward the
top, too close to the bottom, nor too far to one side. See addressed
envelope under <b>&sect;173</b>. Place the <a name="page_165"><span
class="page">Page 165</span></a> stamp squarely in the upper right-hand
corner, not obliquely to the sides of the envelope.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>172. Punctuation of Outside Address.</b> Punctuation may be
omitted at the end of the lines of the address. If it is used,
place a period at the end of the last line, and a comma after each
preceding line.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Within the lines punctuate just as you would in the inside address.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If an abbreviation ends the line, always place a period after it,
whether the other lines are punctuated or not.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>173. Faults in the Outside Address.</b> Avoid the use of
abbreviations except those that would be proper in the inside address
or in the heading. See <b>&sect;&sect; 155</b> and <b>158</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Do not use the sign # before the number of the street address. No
letters or sign at all should be used there. See <b>&sect;155</b>.

Dear Aunt Emily:

<p class="indent">
You will no doubt be surprised when you read the heading of this
letter and learn that we are now in Vienna. We had really intended,
as I wrote to you, to spend the entire months of March and April
in Berlin, but a sudden whim sent us on to this city.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Until we came to Vienna I had but a very vague idea of the city,
and thought it a place of little interest. I was surprised to find
it a place of so many beautiful buildings and beautiful streets.
Still more was I surprised to find what a festive, stylish place
it is. Paris may have the reputation for fashion and frivolity,
but Vienna lacks only the reputation; it certainly does not lack
the fashionable and frivolous air.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The other day in one of the shops here, I discovered, as I thought,
<a name="page_171"><span class="page">Page 171</span></a> a very
fine miniature. I purchased it to present to you, and have already
sent it by post. It ought to reach you as soon as this letter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have not received the usual letter from you this week, but suppose
it is because we so suddenly changed our address. The necessity
of forwarding it from Berlin has probably caused the delay.

CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE WHOLE COMPOSITION</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>177.</b> By the term <b>Whole Composition</b> or <b>Theme</b>
is meant a composition consisting of a number of related paragraphs
all dealing with one general subject, whether the composition be
a narration, a description, or an exposition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following general principles applying to the construction of the
whole composition are stated for the guidance of the inexperienced
writer.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>178. Statement of Subject.</b> Care should be used in the statement
of the subject. It should not be so stated as to be more comprehensive
than the composition, but should be limited to cover only what is
discussed. For a small essay, instead of a big subject, take some
limited phase of that subject:
</p>

<p class="indent">
Too broad: <i>College, Photography, Picnics</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Properly limited: <i>A College Education as an Aid to Earning Power,
Does College Life Make Loafers? Photography as a Recreation, How
Picnics Help the Doctor.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>179. The Outline.</b> Just as in the building of a house or of
a machine, if anything creditable is to be attained, a carefully
made plan is necessary before entering on the construction; so
in the writing of an essay or theme, there should be made some
plan or outline, which will determine what different things are
to be discussed, and what is to be the method of developing the
discussion. By the inexperienced writer, at least, a composition
should never be begun until an outline has been formed for its
development. As soon as the material for the composition is in
hand, the outline should <a name="page_175"><span class="page">Page
175</span></a> be made. It should be an aid in the construction of
the composition, not a thing to be derived after the composition is
completed. Only by the previous making of an outline can a logical
arrangement be gained, topics properly subordinated, and a suitable
proportion secured in their discussion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the previous chapter on the paragraph the following different
subtopics, were discussed:
</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tr><td style="width: 50%;">Definition of Paragraph.</td>
    <td>How to Secure Unity.</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Places of emphasis in the paragraph.</td></tr>
      </table>
<li>Practical construction of the paragraph.</li>
<li>The paragraph theme.</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent">
<b>180. Use and Qualities of the Outline.</b> The use of the outline
is not restricted to an expository composition, as above, but is also
necessary in narration and description. Usually, in a narration,
the order of time in which events occurred, is the best order in
which to present them, though other arrangements may frequently
be followed with very good reason.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In a description different methods may be followed. Often a general
description is given, and then followed by a statement of various
details. Thus, in describing a building, one might first describe
in a general way its size, its general style of architecture, and
the impression it makes on the observer. Then more particular
description might be made of its details of arrangement and
peculiarities of architecture and ornamentation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The whole object of the outline is to secure clearness of statement
and to avoid confusion and repetition. To secure this end the outline
should present a few main topics to which all others either lead
up or upon which they depend. These topics or subtopics should all
bear some apparent and logical relation to one another. The relation
may be that of chronology; that of general statement followed by
details; that of cause and effect; or any other relation, so long
as it is a logical and natural one.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The outline should not be too minute and detailed. It should be
sufficient only to cover the various divisions of the subject-matter,
and to prevent the confusion of subtopics. <a name="page_177"><span
class="page">Page 177</span></a> A too detailed outline tends to
make the composition stiff and formal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The outline should have proportion. The essential features of the
subject should be the main topics. Minor subjects should not be
given too great prominence, but should be subordinated to the main
topics.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>181. The Beginning of the Composition.</b> To choose a method
of beginning a composition often causes trouble. Usually a simple,
direct beginning is the best. But sometimes an introductory paragraph
is necessary in order to explain the writer's point of view, or to
indicate to what phases of the subject attention is to be given.
Examine the following methods of beginning.
</p>

<p class="center">
THE INDUSTRY OF LAWYER
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Oddly enough, hardly any notice is taken of an industry in which
the United States towers in unapproachable supremacy above all
other nations of the earth. The census does not say a word about
it, nor does there exist more than the merest word about it in
all the literature of American self-praise.
</p>

<p class="center">
MY CHILDHOOD FEAR OF GHOSTS
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Nothing stands out more keenly in the recollection of my childhood,
than the feelings of terror which I experienced when forced to go
to bed without the protecting light of a lamp. Then it was that
dread, indefinite ghosts lurked behind every door, hid in every
clothes-press, or lay in wait beneath every bed.
</p>

<p class="center">
THE USES OF IRON
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
No other metal is put to so many uses and is so indispensable as
iron.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The opening sentences of a composition should be able to stand
alone; their meaning or clearness should not depend upon reference
to the title.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_178"><span class="page">Page 178</span></a> Bad:

THE VALUE OF LATIN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
There is a rapidly growing belief <i>that this study</i> has too
large a place in our high-school courses of study.

<p class="indent">

THE VALUE OF LATIN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
There is a rapidly growing belief <i>that Latin</i> has too large
a place in our high school courses of study.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>182. Unity in the Composition.</b> Unity is an essential element
of the whole composition as well as of the paragraph, and its demands
here are in general the same. Nothing must be brought into the
composition which does not fall well within the limits of the subject.
In the different subdivisions, also, nothing must be discussed
which properly belongs to some other division of the topic.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As in the paragraph, a definite point of view should be adopted
and adhered to. There must not be a continual changing of relation
of parts of the composition to the subject, nor of the writer's
relation to the subject.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A consistent point of view is especially necessary in a narrative.
If the writer is telling of events within his own experience, care
must be taken not to bring in any conversation or occurrence, at
which, by his own story, he could not have been present. A continual
changing back and forth between present and past tenses must also
be avoided. One or the other should be adopted consistently.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>183. Coherence in the Composition.</b> A composition must also
be coherent. Its different parts must be closely knit together and
the whole closely knit to the subject. Just as in the paragraph,
words of reference and transition are needed, so in the composition,
words, or sentences of reference and transition are needed, in order
to bind the whole together and show the relation of its parts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_179"><span class="page">Page 179</span></a> For this
purpose, the beginning of a new division or any definite change
of topic should be closely marked, so as to prevent confusion.
There should be transition sentences, or sentences which show the
change of topic from paragraph to paragraph, and yet at the same
time bridge the thought from paragraph to paragraph. These transition
sentences may come at the end of a preceding paragraph, or at the
beginning of a following one, or at both of these places.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Examine the following parts of paragraphs in which the words or
phrases showing transition from part to part are italicized:
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Last sentence of first paragraph)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
... The American War was pregnant with misery of every kind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Second paragraph)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>The mischief, however,</i> recoiled on the unhappy people of
this country, who were made the instruments by which the wicked
purposes of the authors were effected. The nation was drained of its
best blood, and of its vital resources of men and money. The expense
of the war was enormous&mdash;much beyond any former experience.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Third paragraph)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>And yet, what has the British nation received in return</i> for
this expense....
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
... I was now enabled to see the <i>extent and aspect of my prison.
In its size</i> I had been greatly mistaken....
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Beginning of paragraph following one on Unity in the paragraph)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>The second of the essentials of the paragraph</i>, coherence,
demands that....
</p>

<p class="indent">
Frequently, in the longer compositions, a separate paragraph is
devoted to accomplishing the transition from part to part. Observe
the following:
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Paragraph 7)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
... The only other law bearing on this matter is the Act of Assembly
of last year authorizing the receipts from the automobile <a
name="page_180"><span class="page">Page 180</span></a> taxes to
be used in the construction of roads. This then completes the
enumeration of what has already been done toward building good roads.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Paragraph 8. Transitional paragraph)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>There are, however, several promising plans for the securing of
this important result, which are now being seriously discussed.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
(Paragraph 9)
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
<i>The first of these plans is</i> ...
</p>

<p class="indent">
The following are a few of the words and phrases often used to
indicate transition and to show relation between the paragraphs:
<i>So much for, It remains to mention, In the next place, Again,
An additional reason, Therefore, Hence, Moreover, As a result of
this, By way of exception.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Examine the selection under <b>&sect;187</b>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>184. The Ending of the Composition.</b> In a longer composition,
the ending should neither be too abrupt, nor, on the other hand,
should it be too long drawn out. It should be in proportion to
the length of the composition. Usually, except in the case of a
story, it should consist of a paragraph or two by way of summary
or inference. In a story, however, the ending may be abrupt or
not. The kind of ending depends entirely upon the nature and the
scheme of development of the story. Examine the following endings:
</p>

<p class="indent">
Ending of a theme on <i>The Uses of Iron</i>:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Only some of the more important uses of this wonderful metal, iron,
have been mentioned. There are hundreds of other uses to which
it is constantly put&mdash;uses which no other metal could fill.
Gold may once have been called the king of metals, but it has long
since lost its claim to that title.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Ending of a story:
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
John heard her answer, and began to move slowly away from the gate.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
"Good-bye," he said.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers, brought forth upon this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition that all men are created equal. <i>Now</i> we are
engaged in a great civil war, testing whether <i>that nation</i>,
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
We are met on a great battle-field of <i>that war</i>. We have
come to dedicate a portion of <i>that field</i> as the final
resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
<i>this. But</i> in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot
consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living
and dead, who <i>struggled here</i> have consecrated it far above
our power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long
remember, what we say here; but it can never forget what <i>they
did here</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
It is for us, the living, <i>rather</i>, to be dedicated here to the
unfinished <a name="page_182"><span class="page">Page 182</span></a>
work which <i>they who fought here</i> have thus far so nobly advanced.
<i>It is rather for us</i> to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure
of devotion; that we here highly resolve that <i>these dead</i>
shall not have died in vain; that <i>this nation</i>, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people,
by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

<b>186.</b> <i>Small Economies</i>, from Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Cranford</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
I have often noticed that everyone has his own individual small
economies&mdash;careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in
some one peculiar direction&mdash;any disturbance of which annoys
him more than spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
An old gentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence of
the failure of a Joint-Stock Bank, in which some of his money was
invested, with a stoical mildness, worried his family all through a
long summer's day because one of them had torn (instead of cutting)
out the written leaves of his now useless bank-book. Of course, the
corresponding pages at the other end came out as well, and this
little unnecessary waste of paper (his private economy) chafed
him more than all the loss of his money. Envelopes fretted his
soul terribly when they first came in. The only way in which he
could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished article
was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him,
and so making them serve again. Even now, though tamed by age, I
see him casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send
a whole inside of a half-sheet of note paper, with the three lines
of acceptance to an invitation, written on only one of the sides.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
I am not above owning that I have this human weakness myself. String
is my foible. My pockets get full of little hanks of it, picked up
and twisted together, ready for uses that never come. I am seriously
annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel instead of patiently and
faithfully undoing it fold by fold. How people can bring themselves
to use india-rubber bands, which are a sort of deification of string,
as lightly as they do, I cannot imagine. To me an india rubber
band is a precious treasure. I have one which is not new&mdash;one
<a name="page_183"><span class="page">Page 183</span></a> that I
picked up off the floor nearly six years ago. I have really tried
to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not commit the
extravagance.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Small pieces of butter grieve others. They cannot attend to conversation
because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some people
have of invariably taking more butter than they want. Have you not
seen the anxious look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on
the article? They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out
of their sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing
it down; and they are really made happy if the person on whose
plate it lies unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast (which
he does not want at all) and eats up his butter. They think that
this is not waste.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
Now Miss Matty Jenkins was chary of candles. We had many devices
to use as few as possible. In the winter afternoons she would sit
knitting for two or three hours&mdash;she could do this in the
dark, or by firelight&mdash;and when I asked if I might not ring
for candles to finish stitching my wristbands, she told me to "keep
blind man's holiday." They were usually brought in with tea; but
we only burnt one at a time. As we lived in constant preparation
for a friend who might come in any evening (but who never did),
it required some contrivance to keep our two candles of the same
length, ready to be lighted, and to look as if we burnt two always.
The candles took it in turns; and, whatever we might be talking or
doing, Miss Matty's eyes were habitually fixed upon the candle,
ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other before
they had become too uneven in length to be restored to equality
in the course of the evening.
</p>

<p class="indent" style="font-size: smaller;">
One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me.
I had been very much tired of my compulsory "blind man's holiday,"
especially as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to
stir the fire and run the risk of awakening her; and so I could
not even sit on the rug, and scorch myself with sewing by firelight,
according to my usual custom....

CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">WORDS.&mdash;SPELLING.&mdash;PRONUNCIATION</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>188.</b> To write and to speak good English, one must have a
good working vocabulary. He must know words and be able to use
them correctly; he must employ only words that are in good use; he
must be able to choose words and phrases that accurately express
his meaning; and he must be able to spell and pronounce correctly
the words that he uses.
</p>

<p class="center_sc">
Words
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>189. Good Use.</b> The first essential that a word should have,
is that it be in good use. A word is in good use when it is used
grammatically and in its true sense, and is also:
</p>

<p class="indent">
(1) <i>Reputable</i>; in use by good authors and writers in general.
The use of a word by one or two good writers is not sufficient to
make a word reputable; the use must be general.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(2) <i>National</i>; not foreign or local in its use.
</p>

<p class="indent">
(3) <i>Present</i>; used by the writers of one's own time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>190. Offenses against Good Use.</b> The offenses against good
use are usually said to be of three classes: Solecisms, Barbarisms,
and Improprieties.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>191. Solecisms</b> are the violations of the principles of grammar.
Solecisms have been treated under the earlier chapters on grammar.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>192. Barbarisms.</b> The second offense against good use, a
barbarism, is a word not in reputable, present or national use.
The following rules may be given on this subject:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. <b>Avoid obsolete words.</b> Obsolete words are words that,
once in good use, have since passed out of general use. <a
name="page_186"><span class="page">Page 186</span></a> This rule
might also be made to include obsolescent words: words that are
at present time passing out of use. Examples of obsolete words:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">methinks</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">yesterwhiles</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">twixt</td></tr>
 <tr><td>yclept</td><td>afeard</td><td>shoon</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
2. <b>Avoid newly coined expressions or new uses of old expressions.</b>
There are a great many words current in the newspapers and in other
hasty writing that have not the sanction of general good use at
the present time, though many of these words may in time come into
use. A safe rule is to avoid all words that are at all doubtful.
Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">an invite</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">an expos&eacute;</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">a try</td></tr>
 <tr><td>enthuse</td><td>a combine</td><td>fake</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
A common newspaper fault is the coining of a verb or adjective from
a noun, or a noun from a verb. Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">locomote</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">suicided</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">derailment</td></tr>
 <tr><td>pluralized</td><td>burglarized</td><td>refereed</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
3. <b>Avoid foreign words.</b> A foreign word should not be used
until it has become naturalized by being in general, reputable use.
Since there are almost always English words just as expressive as
the foreign words, the use of the foreign words usually indicates
affectation on the part of the one using them. Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 50%;">billet-doux (love letter)</td>
     <td>conversazione (conversation)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ad nauseam (to disgust)</td>
     <td>distingu&eacute; (distinguished)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ad infinitum (infinitely)</td>
     <td>entre nous (between us)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
4. <b>Avoid provincialisms.</b> Provincialisms are expressions
current and well understood in one locality, but not current or
differently understood in another locality. Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 50%;">guess (think)</td>
     <td>reckon (suppose)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>near (stingy)</td><td>smart (clever)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>tuckered (tired out)</td><td>lift (elevator)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>tote (carry)</td><td>ruination (ruin)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_187"><span class="page">Page 187</span></a>
5. <b>Avoid vulgarisms.</b> Vulgarisms are words whose use shows
vulgarity or ignorance. Such words as the following are always in
bad taste:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">chaw</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">nigger</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">your'n</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gal</td><td>flustrated</td><td>hadn't oughter</td></tr>
 <tr><td>haint</td><td>dern</td><td>his'n</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
6. <b>Avoid slang.</b> Slang is a form of vulgarism that is very
prevalent in its use even by educated people. Slang words, it is
true, sometimes come into good repute and usage, but the process
is slow. The safest rule is to avoid slang expressions because
of their general bad taste and because of their weakening effect
on one's vocabulary of good words. Examples of slang:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">grind</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">swipe</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">booze</td></tr>
 <tr><td>long green</td><td>on a toot</td><td>dough</td></tr>
 <tr><td>pinch</td><td>peach</td><td>dukes</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
7. <b>Avoid clipped or abbreviated words.</b> The use of such words
is another form of vulgarism. Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 50%;">pard (partner)</td>
     <td style="width: 50%;">rep (reputation)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>doc (doctor)</td><td>cal'late (calculate)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>musee (museum)</td><td>a comp (complimentary ticket)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
8. <b>Avoid technical or professional words.</b> Such words are
usually clearly understood only by persons of one class or profession.
Examples:
</p>

<table class="indent">
 <tr><td style="width: 33%;">valence</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">hagiology</td>
     <td style="width: 33%;">allonge</td></tr>
 <tr><td>kilowatt</td><td>sclerosis</td><td>estoppel</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<b>193. When Barbarisms May be Used.</b> In the foregoing rules
barbarisms have been treated as at all times to be avoided. This
is true of their use in general composition, and in a measure true
of their use in composition of a special nature. But barbarisms may
sometimes be used properly. Obsolete words would be permissible in
poetry or in historical <a name="page_188"><span class="page">Page
188</span></a> novels, technical words permissible in technical
writing, and even vulgarisms and provincialisms permissible in
dialect stories.
</p>

<p class="exercise">Exercise 76</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Substitute for each of the barbarisms in the following list
an expression that is in good use. When in doubt consult a good
dictionary:</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Chaw, quoth, fake, reckon, dern, forsooth, his'n, an invite, entre
nous, tote, hadn't oughter, yclept, a combine, ain't, dole, a try,
nouveau riche, puny, grub, twain, a boom, alter ego, a poke, cuss,
eld, enthused, mesalliance, tollable, disremember, locomote, a right
smart ways, chink, afeard, orate, nary a one, yore, pluralized,
distingu&eacute;, ruination, complected, mayhap, burglarized, mal
de mer, tuckered, grind, near, suicided, callate, cracker-jack,
erst, railroaded, chic, down town, deceased (verb), a rig, swipe,
spake, on a toot, knocker, peradventure, guess, prof, classy, booze,
per se, cute, biz, bug-house, swell, opry, rep, photo, cinch, corker,
in cahoot, pants, fess up, exam, bike, incog, zoo, secondhanded,
getable, outclassed, gents, mucker, galoot, dub, up against it,
on tick, to rattle, in hock, busted on the bum, to watch out, get
left.

for them as many good substitute expressions as you can. Practice
using the good expressions that you have made.</i>

Improprieties.</b> The third offense against good use, an impropriety,
is the use of a proper word in an improper sense. In many cases an
offense against good use may be called a barbarism, an impropriety,
or a solecism, since the fields covered by the three terms somewhat
overlap one another. Many improprieties have their origin in the
similarities in sound, spelling or meaning of words. The following
exercises deal with a number of common improprieties resulting
from the confusion of two similar words.

<b>195. Idioms.</b> There are in English, as in other languages,
a number of expressions that cannot be justified by the rules of
grammar or rhetoric; and yet these expressions are among the most
forcible ones in the language, and are continually used by the best
writers. These expressions that lie outside all rules we call idioms.
Compare the following idiomatic expressions with the unidiomatic
expressions that succeed them. The second expression in each group
is in accord with the strict rules of composition; but the first,
the idiomatic, is far more forceful.
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Idiomatic: The book which I read about.
  <a name="page_199"><span class="page">Page 199</span></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Unidiomatic: The book about which I
    read.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Idiomatic: More than one life was
   lost.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Unidiomatic: More lives than one life
   were lost.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Idiomatic: Speak loud. Speak
   louder.</td></tr>

   loudly.</td></tr>

   and main are two words of the same meaning.)</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
 <tr><td class="indent">Idiomatic: He lectured on every other
   day.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Unidiomatic: He lectured on one day out
   of every two.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
Idioms are not to be avoided. On the contrary, because they contribute
great ease and force to composition, their use is to be encouraged.
But the distinction between idiomatic and unidiomatic expressions
is a fine one, and rests solely on usage. Care must be taken not
to go beyond the idiomatic. There is probably little danger that
the ordinary writer or speaker will not use idioms enough.
</p>

<p class="indent">

<b>196. Choice of Words.</b> The words in which a thought is expressed
may not offend against good use, and yet still be objectionable because
they do not accurately and appropriately express the thought. One
should choose not merely a word that will approximately express
the thought, but the one word that best expresses it. The following
suggestions are given to aid in the choice of words:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. <b>Choose simple English words</b> and avoid what is called
"fine writing." Young writers and newspaper writers are greatly
given to this offense of fine or bombastic writing. Examples:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%;">
 <tr><td style="width: 50%; padding-left: 2em;">FINE WRITING</td>
     <td style="width: 50%; padding-left: 2em;">SIMPLE STYLE</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Was launched into eternity</td><td>Was hanged</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Disastrous conflagration</td><td>Great fire</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Called into requisition the services of the family
   physician</td><td>Sent for the doctor</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Was accorded an ovation</td><td>Was applauded</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Palatial mansion</td><td>Comfortable house</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Acute auricular perceptions</td><td>Sharp ears</td></tr>
 <tr><td>A disciple of Izaak Walton</td><td>A fisherman</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_201"><span class="page">Page 201</span></a>
2. <b>Distinguish between general and specific terms.</b> In some cases
general words may be used to advantage, but more often specific
words should be used, since they call to the mind a definite image.
Compare these sentences:
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">The <i>high color</i> of his face showed his
       embarrassment.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">His <i>crimson</i> face showed his
       embarrassment.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">He was a <i>large</i> man.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">He was a <i>fat</i> man.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">He was a man of <i>large
   frame</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">He was a <i>tall, heavily
   proportioned</i> man.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">He was a man <i>six feet four inches
   tall</i> and <i>heavy</i> in proportion.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">It was an <i>impressive</i>
   building.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">It was a building of <i>impressive
   size</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">It was a building of <i>impressive
   beauty</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">His <i>fault</i> was robbery.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">His <i>crime</i> was robbery.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
3. <b>Avoid over-statement of facts.</b> The use of words that
are too strong is a fault especially characteristic of Americans.
Examples:
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Poor: The concert was <i>simply
   exquisite</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Better: The concert was <i>very
   good</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">Poor: She was <i>wild</i> over the
   mistake.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">Better: She was <i>much annoyed</i>
   by the mistake.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
4. <b>Avoid hackneyed phrases;</b> expressions that have been worked
to death. Examples:
</p>

<table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
 <tr><td class="indent">His paternal acres.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">The infuriated beast.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="indent">The gentle zephyrs of springtime.</td></tr>

suggestions may be found helpful in the acquiring of a good vocabulary:
</p>

<p class="indent">
1. <b>Cultivate the dictionary habit.</b> Learn the meaning,
pronunciation, and spelling of each new word that you meet. Only
when these three things are grasped about each word, does one really
know the word. Some persons have found it an invaluable aid to
carry with them a small note book or card on which they note down
to be looked up at a convenient time words concerning which they
are in doubt.
</p>

<p class="indent">
2. <b>In your writing and speaking use as much as possible the new
words that you acquire.</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
3. <b>Construct good English expressions</b> for all the slang,
fine writing, and hackneyed phrases that you meet, and then use
the good expressions instead of the bad ones.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_204"><span class="page">Page 204</span></a> 4. <b>Study
synonyms</b>; words of similar form and meaning. Only by a knowledge
of synonyms can you express fine shades of meaning. <i>Crabbe's</i>
English Synonyms and <i>Fernald's</i> Synonyms and Antonyms are good
books of reference for this purpose. In addition to these books,
lists of synonyms will be found in many books that are designed
for general reference.

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
